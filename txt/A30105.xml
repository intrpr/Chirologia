    <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
    <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
    <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
    <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
    <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
    <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
    <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
    <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
    <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

      <head>TO HIS HEROIQVE FRIEND, <em>EDWARD GOLDSMITH</em> of GRAIES-INNE, <em>Esq.</em>

       <seg rend="decorInit">When I first (according to my open and free manner of communication to my Intellectuall Friendes) shewed you a Copie of my <em>Idea,</em> which acquainted you with my scope and generall projection upon <em>Gesture;</em> you were pleased (as in a Platonique extasie of apprehension) to admire the vastnesse of the Designe, to applaud the rise thereof, and the promising aspect it had to the advancement of Learning; insomuch as fill'd with the benevolent influence and illustration of a Prophetique rapture, you turn'd <em>Chiromancer,</em> divining by the lines of <em>life</em> and <em>prosperity,</em> which appeared faire unto you in the first draught; that the <em>Hand</em> would be embraced and kissed by the more intelligent part of the world, and in time travell and learne to speake (as it doth naturally) so literally all Languages. This strong reflection of your conceits on my early undertakings, you have by the vivacity of a mastering phansie, oftentimes endeavoured to propagate in the opinions of your most <em>generous Acquaintances,</em> which as they were the friendly efforts of a subtle perspicacity of your Iudgement (which I have heard a <em>Great Critique</em> to acknowledge to be the <em>genuine felicity</em> of your <em>intellect,</em> whereby you are able to dissect the least atome of a <em>Philosophicall projection:)</em> I have (though the raising of expectation proves many times an injurious courtesie) took as a good omen to advance upon. What was then a cloud that had neither the shape, nor bignes of a mans <em>Hand,</em> is now growne fit to be held up, and by its owne suffrage to chuse and confirme you its Patron: For, I affecting no Dedication that rises above the levell of <em>Friendship,</em> having intentionally consecrated all the issues of my recesse and leisure to certaine select Friends; This both by <em>prescription</em> and <em>signiority</em> of acquaintance as by a <em>Prerogative,</em> and by a reciprocation of <em>love</em> for your affection to it, falls to your <em>Tuition.</em> I confesse some other of my digested thoughts strugled for precedencie, claiming by the analogie of <em>Natures</em> usuall course, and the <em>Head</em> would have had the priviledge of <em>primogeniture:</em> But it fell out in the contention somewhat like as in the case of <em>Tamars</em> twins, where <em>Zarah</em> put forth his <em>Hand,</em> and the midwife said, <em>This is come out first.</em> However this <em>Chirosophie</em> or first Fruits of my <em>Hand</em> be accepted abroad, having put forth my <em>Right Hand</em> in signe of amity to you, and for performance of promise: there remaines nothing (most noble <em>Chirophilus)</em> but that you take it between Yours in token of warranty and protection, as the tender off-spring of one who is</p>

This Copy of my IDEA;
OR THE
Hint, Scope, and generall Projection.

<pb facs="tcp:110295:5"/>
visited, and that is <em>Gesture. Aristotle</em> (saith he) <em>ingeniosè &amp; solertèr, corporis fabricam, dum quiescit, tractavit, eandem in motu, nimirum gestus corporis, omisit,</em> that is, he hath very ingeniously and diligently handled the <em>factures</em> of the Body, but not the <em>Gestures</em> of the Body, which are no lesse comprehensible by Art, and of great use and advantage, as being no small part of civill prudence. For, the lineaments of the Body doe disclose the disposition and inclination of the minde in generall; but the motions doe not only so, but doe further disclose the present humour and state of the minde and will; for as the
<pb facs="tcp:110295:6"/>
Tongue speaketh to the Eare, so <em>Gesture</em> speaketh to the Eye, and therefore a number of such persons whose Eyes doe dwell upon the Faces and fashions of men, do well know the advantage of this observation, as being most part of their ability; neither can it bee denied but that it is a great discoverer of dissimulation, and great direction in businesse. For, after one manner almost we clappe our <em>Hands</em> in joy, wring them in sorrow, advance them in prayer and admiration; shake our Head in disdaine, wrinkle our Forehead in dislike, crispe our nose in anger, blush in shame, and so for the most part of the more subtile motions.
<pb facs="tcp:110295:6"/>
Taking (therefore) from hence my Hint, I shal attempt to advance in the scrutinie and search after the scattered glances, and touches of Antiquity, tracing them through most classicall Authors, with intent to reduce them into one continued and intire History, propounding this form to my self, to handle <em>Gesture,</em> as the only speech and generall language of Humane Nature. For ballast to the subject, and to make the matter in <em>Hand</em> more sollid and substantive, I shall annex consultations with Nature, affording a glosse of their causes: And for the further embellishing thereof, I shall inrich most points of expression
<pb facs="tcp:110295:7"/>
with examples both of Sacred and prophane Authority, more especially drawne from Poets and Historians, the only great Doctors in this point of Humane literature; wherein, by the way, I shall lay claime to all metaphors, proverbiall translations or usurpations, and all kinde of symbolicall Elegancies taken and borrowed from Gestures of the Body, with the depredations the subtiler Arts of Speech have made upon them for the advancement and exaltation of their particular inventions and designes. All these (together with the civill rites, and ceremonious customes and fashions of divers Nations in their
<pb facs="tcp:110295:7"/>
nationall expressions by Gesture, with the personall properties and genuine habits particular men) being but as so many severall lines that meet in an angle, and touch in this point; I intend to reduce and bring home to their fountaine and common parent the Body of man. Two Amphitheaters there are in the Body, whereon most of these patheticall subtilties are exhibited by Nature, in way of <em>discovery</em> or <em>impression,</em> proceeding either from the effect of sufferance, or the voluntary motions of the Minde, which effect those impressions on the parts which wee call the Speaking Motions, or Discoursing
<pb facs="tcp:110295:8"/>
Gestures, and naturall Language of the Body, to wit, the <em>Hand</em> and the <em>Head;</em> in answer whereof, I intend two receptacles of the observations, falling within the compasse of their particular Districts, under the generall Titles of <em>Chirologia</em> and <em>Cephalelogia, The naturall language of the Hand,</em> and <em>The naturall language of the Head;</em> and these two comprise the best part of the expressions of Humane Nature. <em>Chironomia,</em> or the <em>Rule of the Hand</em> is adjoyned as the perfection and sublimation of <em>Chirologie;</em> as <em>Cephalenomia,</em> or the <em>Rule of the Head,</em> is to appeare with
<pb facs="tcp:110295:8"/>
       <em>Cephalelogia,</em> as being the qualification of all Cephalicall expressions, according to the Lawes of <em>Civill Prudence.</em> The personall or genuine expressions fall in with these. What I finde remarkable in the naturall expressions of the other parts, I shall refer to a generall Rendevouze, wherein I shall take a muster of the Postures and Gestures of the Body in generall. All that I shall have to say more to the <em>Hand</em> in point of <em>Gesture,</em> is under the Title of <em>Chirethnicalogia,</em> or the <em>Nationall expression of the Hand.</em> This I account my left Hand. By this <em>Clavis</em> (I suppose) the <em>Intellectuall Reader</em>
       <pb facs="tcp:110295:9"/>
will see that the Work wil be supplementall to Learning, and not of supererogation, New, and in regard of the generality of the Designe, never attempted by any, affording profitable hints to such ingenious spirits, who desire to understand the mysterious properties, of so admirable and important a piece of themselves.</p>

      <head>Chirologia? OR THE NATVRALL LANGVAGE Of the HAND.</head>
      <p>
       <seg rend="decorInit">IN all the declarative conceits of Gesture, whereby the Body, instructed by Nature, can emphatically vent, and communicate a thought, and in the propriety of its utterance expresse the silent agitations of the minde; the <em>Hand,</em> that busie instrument, is most <em>talkative,</em> whose <em>language</em> is as easily perceived and understood, as if Man had another mouth or fountaine of discourse in his <em>Hand.</em> So proper and apt to make signes, and work great matters is the <em>Hand</em> of Man; It seems to me observable, that when <em>Moses</em> covertly desired <note place="margin">Exod. 4. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, verses.</note> a signe of God, to make the Aegyptians believe He had appeared unto him, God presently asked him what he had in his <em>Hand?</em> and commands him naturall gestures which had thence the force of miraculous signification: and to these signes, God attributes a voice, for He saith, If they will not hearken to the voice of the first
<pb facs="tcp:110295:16"/>
signe, they will believe the voice of the latter signe: (and as there is in the supernaturall, so there is a signifying voyce in the naturall signes of the <em>Hand.) Althusius</em> calls these miraculous <note place="margin">Althusius de civili conversatione, li. 1.</note> expressions of the <em>Hand, habitus portentosos,</em> which by their rare and illustrious action denote and expresse some singular and memorable intention by the command of God, besides their naturall signification. For, the <em>Hand</em> being the <em>Substitute</em> and <em>Vicegerent</em> of the Tongue, in a full, and majestique way of expression, presents the <em>signifying faculties</em> of the soule, and the inward discourse of Reason: and as <em>another Tongue,</em> which we may justly call the <em>Spokesman</em> of the Body, it <em>speakes</em> for all the members thereof, denoting their <em>Suffrages,</em> and including their <em>Votes.</em> So that whatsoever thought can be delivered, or made <em>significantly manifest,</em> by the united motions and connative endeavours of all the other members: the same may be as evidently exhibited by the sole devoyre, and <em>discoursing gestures</em> of the <em>Hand.</em> The intendments of which demonstrative gestures (being naturall signes) have no dependance on any ordinance or Statute of Art, which may be broken off, or taken <em>in hand;</em> as it is either repealed, or stands in force: but these being part of the unalterable Lawes and Institutes of Nature, are by their owne perpetuall constitution, and by a native consequence significant. As smoke which in darke vapours expires from incensed fuell is a certaine signe of fire; or as rich smells by whose aromatique breath the ayer's perfum'd, doe sweetly declare the presence of the ascended odour: and as the blushes of <em>Aurora</em> bewray the early approach of the bright Emperour
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110295:16"/>
of the day: So that in these Art hath no <em>Hand,</em> since they proceed from the meere instinct of Nature: and all these motions and habits of the <em>Hand</em> are purely naturall, not positive; nor in their senses remote from the true nature of the things that are implyed. The naturall resemblance and congruity of which expressions, result from the habits of the minde, by the effort of an impetuous affection wrought in the invaded <em>Hand,</em> which is made very plyant for such impressions. But whereas these speaking Organs are couplets, an active paire; sometimes they both, and not seldome one alone doth by a neat insinuation of speech, make and accomplish the habit. Sometimes differing words, which visibly grow on one root of action, goe for Synonima's in gesture: and we shall sometimes see contrarietie of patheticall expression, in identity of posture.</p>
      <p>Nor doth the <em>Hand</em> in one speech or kinde of language serve to intimate and expresse our mind: It speakes all languages, and as an <em>universall character of Reason,</em> is generally understood and knowne by all Nations, among the formall differences of their Tongue. And being the onely speech that is naturall to Man, it may well be called the <em>Tongue and generall language of Humane Nature,</em> which, without teaching, men in all regions of the habitable world doe at the first sight most easily understand. This is evident by that trade and commerce with those salvage Nations who have long injoy'd the late discovered principalities of the West, with whom (although their Language be strange and unknowne) our Merchants barter and exchange their Wares,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110295:17"/>
driving a rich and silent Trade, by signes, whereby many a dumb bargaine without the crafty Brocage of the Tongue, is advantageously made. Hence 'tis apparent, that there's no native law, or absolute necessity, that those thoughts which arise in our pregnant minde, must by mediation of our Tongue flow out in a vocall streame of words; unto which purpose we must attend the leisure of that inclosed instrument of speech: Since whatsoever is perceptible unto sense, and capable of a due and fitting difference; hath a naturall competency to expresse the motives and affections of the Minde; in whose labours, the <em>Hand,</em> which is a ready Midwife, takes oftentimes the thoughts from the forestalled Tongue, making a more quicke dispatch by gesture: for when the fancy hath once wrought upon the <em>Hand,</em> our conceptions are display'd and utter'd in the very moment of a thought. For, the gesture of the <em>Hand</em> many times gives a hint of our intention, and speakes out a good part of our meaning, before our words, which accompany or follow it, can put themselves into a vocall posture to be understood. And as in the report of a Piece, the eye being the nimbler sense, discernes the discharge before any intelligence by conduct of the vocall Wave arrive at the eare; although the flash and the report are twins born at the instant of the Pieces going off: so although Speech and Gesture are conceived together in the minde, yet the <em>Hand</em> first appearing in the delivery, anticipates the Tongue, in so much as many times the Tongue perceiving her self forestall'd, spares it selfe a labour; to prevent a needlesse Tautologie: And if words ensue upon the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110295:17"/>
gesture, their addition serves but as a Comment for the fuller explication of the manuall Text of utterance; and implyes nothing over and above but a generall devoyre of the minde to be perfectly understood. A notable argument we have of this <em>discoursing facultie</em> of the <em>Hand</em> in our common Jesters, who without their voice, speaking onely by gestures, can counterfeit the manners, fashions, and significant actions of men. Which may be more confirm'd by that wonder of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
        <desc>••</desc>
       </gap>
       cessity which Nature worketh in men that are borne deafe and dumbe; who can argue and dispute rhetorically by signes, and with a kinde of mute and logistique eloquence overcome their amaz'd opponents; wherein some are so ready &amp; excellent, they seeme to want nothing to have their meanings perfectly understood. Tis parallel to this, what Natures grand Inquisitor reports of certaine Nations, that have no other language <note place="margin">Plin. Hist. Nat.</note> wherein to impart their mindes; the common tongue of Beasts, who by gestures declare their senses, and dumb affections. For although <em>Seneca</em>
       <note place="margin">Seneca de Ira lib. 1. cap. 3.</note> will not allow their motions to be affections, but certain characters &amp; impressions <em>ad similitudinem passionum,</em> like unto passions in men, which he calleth <em>impetus,</em> the risings, forces and impulsions of Nature, upon the view of such objects as are apt to strike any impressions upon it: yet as <em>Montaigne</em> (in that elegant Essay of his, where he in <note place="margin">Montaign Essay in Raimond Sebond.</note> imitation of <em>Plutarch,</em> maintaines that Beasts participate with us in the rationality of their discourses) shewes, that even they that have no voyce at all, by their reciprocall kindnesse, which we see in them, we easily inferre there are some other meanes of entercommunication: their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110295:18"/>
gestures treat, and their motions discourse.
<q>
        <l>Non alia longè ratione atque ipsa videtur</l>
        <l>Protrahere ad Gestum, pueros infantia linguae. </l>
       </q>
       <q>
        <l>No otherwise, then for they cannot speake,</l>
        <l>Children are drawne by signes their mindes to breake.</l>
       </q>
      </p>
      <p>And why not (saith he) as well as our dumbe men dispute and tell histories by signes? Certainly (as he well observeth) there is a society and communion of justice, fellowship, good wil, and affection betweene us and Brutes: they being not so remote from good nature, gentlenesse, and sweet converse, but that they can expresse their desire of honour, generositie, industrious sagacity, courage, magnanimity, and their love and feare; neither are they void of subtilty and wisedome. For by reason of their affinity as it were, and daily conversation with men, they get a tincture from us of our manners and fashions, and consequently enjoy a kinde of nurture and teaching discipline, and apprentising by imitation, which does enable them to understand and expresse themselves in this language of gesture, teaching us by learning of us, that capable they be not onely of the inward discourse of Reason, but of the outward gift of utterance by gesture: and if there be some gestures of ours that they doe not understand, so there are some of theirs which need an Interpretor, a greater Critique in their language then <em>Democritus Melampus,</em> or <em>Apollonius Thyaneus</em> were, who understood all the idiomes of Birds and Beasts, to expound them unto us. <em>Plato</em> in setting out the golden Age under <em>Saturne,</em> reckons among the chiefest advantages, this kinde of communication. And indeed it is a kinde of knowledge that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110295:18"/>
       <em>Adam</em> partly lost with his innocency, yet might be repaired in us, by a diligent observation and marking of the outward effects of the inward and secret motions of beasts.</p>
      <p>This <em>naturall Language of the Hand,</em> as it had the happinesse to escape the curse at the confusion of Babel: so it hath since been sanctified and made a holy language by the expressions of our Saviours <em>Hands;</em> whose gestures have given a sacred allowance to the naturall significations of ours. And God speakes to us by the signes of his <em>Hand</em> (as <em>Bernard</em> observes) when he works wonders, which are the proper signes of his <em>Hand. Hic est Digitus Dei,</em> say the astonished <em>Magi,</em> when they acknowledged the expression of a Divine <em>Hand.</em> These signes in <em>Bernards</em> language, <note place="margin">Bernard. lib. 2. in Cantica.</note> are <em>notae stelliferae,</em> blazing and Starrie expressions.

made the highest tone of our Tongue too low to reach the auditory nerve of one that is remote: or when the noise of some eare-deafing crowd hath rendred our Tongue unserviceable to declare our minde; we use the visible expressions of our <em>Hand,</em> as more loud and demonstrative, which are afarre off perceived and understood by those who were uncapable of an auricular intimation.

        </p>
        <p>An example of this naturall gesture and expression, we finde to have appeared in the <em>Hand</em> of <em>Julius,</em> who endeavouring to satisfie the desires of <em>Constantius,</em> but the souldiers forcing him to accept of the stile of <em>Augustus,</em> with a resolute and well grounded minde withstood them all <note place="margin">Ammian. Marcellin. lib. 20.</note> and some, one time shewing himself to be wroth and highly displeased, other whiles STRETCHING FORTH HIS HANDS, <em>requesting</em> and <em>beseeching</em> them to forbeare their unseasonable offer. When <em>Annibal</em> after the battaile of <em>Cannae</em> had granted the Romanes the favour and liberty to redeeme their prisoners, and <em>M. Junius</em> had ended his Oration in the Senate, immediately <note place="margin">Livie lib. 22.</note> the multitude that were gathered together in the common place, set up a lamentable and piteous cry, and HELD OUT THEIR HANDS to the Councell-house, <em>beseeching</em> the Lords of the Senate that they might have and injoy their children, their brethren, and kinsfolkes againe. The Noblemen in the behalfe of <em>Coriolanus</em> used <note place="margin">Plutarch in the life of Coriolanus.</note> this gesture of the <em>Hand</em> when <em>Sicinius</em> the Tribune had pronounced sentence of death upon him, for, some of them HOLDING FORTH THEIR HANDS to the people, <em>besought</em> them not to handle them so cruelly. Thus <em>Manlius</em> and <em>Fulvius</em> comming unto <em>Tiberius</em> with teares in their eyes, and HOLDING UP THEIR HANDS, <em>besought</em> him to let the Law <em>Agraria</em> alone, which <note place="margin">Plut. in the life of Tiberius and Caius</note> he would then have passed. And <em>Plutarch</em> in that notable description of <em>Aemilius</em> triumph relates, how King <em>Perseus</em> children were led prisoners with the traine of their Schoolmasters and other Officers and their servants, weeping and lamenting, HOLDING OUT THEIR HANDS unto <note place="margin">Ib. in the life of Paulus Aemylius.</note> the people that looked upon them, and taught the Kings young children to doe the like, to <em>aske mercy and grace</em> at the peoples <em>Hands.</em> The force of this expression hath sometimes remained in the Arme when the <em>Hand</em> hath beene lost. For <em>Amynias</em> the brother of <em>Aeschylus</em> the Tragedian, when the people of <em>Athens</em> would have stoned his brother for some impiety brought on the <note place="margin">Aelian. var.

        <p>TO RAISE THE HAND CONIOYNED OR SPREAD OUT TOWARDS HEAVEN is the  habit of <em>Devotion,</em> and a naturall and universall forme of <em>Prayer,</em> practised by those who are in <em>adversity,</em> and in <em>bitter anguish of Minde;</em> and by those who <em>give publique thankes and praise to the most High.</em> Thus we <em>acknowledge our offences, aske mercy, beg reliefe, pay our vowes, imprecate, complaine, submit, invoke,</em> and <em>are suppliant.</em> Hence 'tis the Scriptures doe most emphatically <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 8</note> define <em>prayer</em> by this outward signe, not that this speaking habit of the <em>Hand</em> is all or the most principall part of <em>devotion,</em> for, Hyppocrites, as if fired with <em>zeale,</em> EXTEND THEIR ARMES AND HANDS, who yet but mock God by seeming to <em>draw nigh</em> unto Him, when their Hearts belie their <em>Hands.</em> But, this gesture is an outward helpe unto <em>devotion,</em> appointed by the ordinance of Nature to expresse the <em>holy fervour of our affections.</em> For since it is impossible by reason of our great infirmitie, we should with our soaring thoughts move beyond the centre of our bodies; we stand in need of some outward help to declare the <em>ascension of our inward zeale,</em> which we reveale by the EXTENSION OF OUR HANDS, which supplying the place of wings, helpe our hearts in their flight upward. For unlesse our hearts are polluted with the leaven of hypocrisie, they raise the heart to the

throne of grace, before which we present our <em>supplications.</em> But the Soul being invisible, unles she shew her selfe by demonstration of gesture, the <em>Hand</em> was instituted <em>Surrogate,</em> and <em>Vicar</em> of of the Heart, to testifie by outward gesture, the <em>offering and lifting up of the Heart,</em> and that our <em>prayers are seriously poured out from the bottome of our Breast.</em> Hence in those sacred Monuments that keepe alive the memories of the Dead, whether their effigies be exhibited in brasse or marble their monumentall Statues are commonly hew'd into this forme of <em>prayer.</em> From the practice and naturall propensity of the <em>Hands</em> to prayer, as from the premisses, <em>Athanasius</em> (as it is likely) drew this conclusion: That therefore man had <em>Hands</em> given him, that they might serve to necessary uses, and to be SPREAD FORTH AND LIFTED UP in <em>offering prayer</em> to Him who made them. It being <em>on all hands</em> confest, that this gesture is an originall rite, and a piece of the discipline of Nature, polished also by the rule of reason, and solemniz'd by the examples and exhortations of wise men. For there was no Nation instructed in any kinde of piety, who did not know <em>before hand</em> by a tacite acknowledgement of a God, that the <em>Hands</em> in <em>prayer</em> were to bee LIFTED UP. <em>Omnes homines <note n="*" place="margin">Arist. lib. de Mund. </note> tendimus manus ad Coelum cum [praeces fundimus,]</em> sayes that <em>Prince of Peripatetiques.</em> And <em>Gobrias</em> in <em>Xenophon</em> seems to confirme the same.<note place="margin">Xenoph.

         <em>the gods</em> (as <em>Calisthenes</em> writeth) that if it were true he was begotten of <em>Jupiter,</em> that it would please them that day to helpe him, and to encourage the Grecians. And the Heathens when they came forth in the morning to plough, they laid one <em>Hand</em> upon the stilt of the plough, and LIFTED THE OTHER UP to <em>Ceres</em> the goddesse of Corne: beginning both their actions of warre and peace with this gesture. So remarkable was the mixt and double office wherein Nature hath interessed the <em>Hand.</em> For as we raise these to Heaven, so with them we worke; and the <em>Hand</em> thrives but ill that workes, unlesse it <em>prayes:</em> which these Heathens by the instinct of Nature were wrought to acknowledge. And the most desperate Atheists and Hypocrites, in some extremities and damages, doe LIFT UP THEIR IOYNED HANDS TO HEAVEN, as a signe and token of some <em>devotion,</em> though they have no faith nor beliefe. ¶ Thus also they <em>gave thanks.</em> It is reported that when <em>Archidamas</em> had overcome the Arcadians, and returned home <note place="margin">Plutarch in the life of Agesilaus.</note> victorious to <em>Sparta,</em> from that tearlesse battaile; neither man nor woman would keepe the City, but came flocking down to the River side, HOLDING UP THEIR HANDS TO HEAVEN, and <em>thanked the gods,</em> as if their City had redeemed and recovered her shame and lost honour, and began to rise againe as before it did. And to the signification of this gesture that of <em>Virgil</em> may be  referred.

God requireth the whole man; there being a woe pronounced to fainting <em>Hands,</em> that is, which faint in prayer. When <em>Moses</em> HELD UP HIS HANDS, <em>Israel</em> prevailed: but when <em>Moses</em> LET <note place="margin">Ex. 17. 11.</note> HIS HANDS DOWN, <em>Amalech</em> prevailed. And when <em>Moses Hands</em> were heavie, they tooke a stone and put it under him, and he sate upon it: and <em>Aaron</em> and <em>Hur</em> stayd up his <em>Hands</em> the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; so his <em>Hands</em> were steady untill the going downe of the Sunne: and <em>Josuah</em> discomfited <em>Amalech.</em> Upon which <em>Philo</em> allegorizing, shewes that victorious <note place="margin">Philo Judaeus in Exod.</note> gesture of <em>Moses Hands</em> doth signifie that by the <em>vertue and intention of prayer all things are overcome:</em> or it implyes <em>the elevation of the intellect to sublime contemplations,</em> and then <em>Amalech,</em> that is, the affections are overcome.</p>

         </gap>s his superstitious observations thus: To joyne the hands in prayer, and so to applie their upper parts to the mouth, doth signifie that men in prayer should seeke to be conjoyn'd to one that is most High: and because prayer proceeds from the mouth, and the <em>Hands</em> upright with the mouth transverse, seeme to delineate a Roman T, he hath another inference from that similitude.</p>
        <p>The STRETCHING OUT THE HANDS TO GOD is sometimes taken in Scripture for the <em>acknowledgement of an offence,</em> as in the <em>prayer</em>
         <note place="margin">1 King. 8. 38.</note> of <em>Solomon</em> at the consecration of the Temple: and <em>Solomon praying,</em> STRETCHED FORTH <note place="margin">1 King. 8. 22.</note> HIS HANDS TO HEAVEN after this manner, And thus <em>Moses praying</em> STRSETCHED OUT <note place="margin">Exod. 9. 29. &amp; 33.</note> HIS HANDS UNTO THE LORD. Thus <em>Judas Macchabeus</em> encountring the army of <em>Nicanor,</em>
         <note place="margin">2 Macch. 15. 21.</note> STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS TOWARDS HEAVEN, and called upon the Lord that worketh wonders. ¶ To the signification of anguish and affliction belongs that of the Prophet <em>Jeremiah,</em> Zion SPREADETH FORTH HER HANDS, <note place="margin">Lament. 1. 17.</note> and there is none to comfort her. For they who <em>pray</em> sometimes STRETCH OUT THEIR HANDS &amp; somtimes LIFT THEM UP. Hence <em>Lauretus,</em> to SPREAD OUT, or EXTEND THE HAND, is to open, dilate, and unfold that which was straitned <note place="margin">Lauret. in Sylv. Alleg.</note> and folded in. To SPREAD OUT THE HAND is also to lift it up: but to EXTEND, is to erect and

         </gap> the sacred sense of these speaking gestures of <em>prayer.</em> S. <em>Hillarie</em>
         <note place="margin">S. Hillar. in Psalm.</note> very elegantly distinguisheth betweene the EXPANSION and ELEVATION of the <em>Hands,</em> which in this matter of <em>prayer</em> are promiscuously used in Scripture. So upon that of the Psalmist, I will <note place="margin">Psal. 63. 4.</note> LIFT UP MY HANDS in thy Name, hee doth not take it for the habit of <em>praying,</em> but for a declaration of a worke of a high elevation. So likewise upon such a passage of another Psalme: Let my <note place="margin">Psa. 140. 2.</note> prayer be set forth before thee as incense, and the LIFTING UP OF MY HANDS as the <em>evening Sacrifice.</em> He shewes that the Apostle where he <note place="margin">S. Paul to Timoth.</note> exhorts them to LIFT UP pure <em>Hands,</em> hee does not appoint a habit of <em>praying,</em> but addes a rule of <em>divine operation.</em> So the noble Prophet, <note place="margin">Isaiah.</note> when you SPREAD FORTH YOUR HANDS, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when you make many <em>prayers</em> I will not heare: if you EXTEND YOUR HANDS, not if you LIFT THEM UP; but if you EXTEND YOUR HANDS: because the habit of <em>praier</em> is in the SPREAD OUT HANDS; but the power of a perfect worke is in the ELEVATION. Therefore the LIFTING UP THE HANDS is an <em>Evening Sacrifice.</em> But this, for all I can finde, is but the peculiar fancie of this Father. For surely the ELEVATION as well as the EXPANSION or STRETCHING OUT OF THE HANDS, are both significantly naturall in this sense. Indeed S<hi rend="sup">t</em>. <em>Hierome</em> drawes these two <note place="margin">S. Hier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:110295:25"/>
who dilates in the evaporation of a vain mouth: and who against the grace of the Giver, is proud of the virtue of his workes.</p>

         <em>Calvin</em> in his Comment upon <em>Timothy,</em> (upon <note place="margin">Calvin. comment. in 1 Tim. 2.</note> which place <em>Cornelius à Lapide</em> hath also noted many things,) observing that the Apostle hath put the signe of prayer for the thing signified, sayes that this expression of gesture is very agreeable to true piety; so the verity that is figured thereby doe answer the signification; to wit, that being by nature admonished that God is to be sought for in heaven, that first wee should put off all terrene and carnall imaginations of Him, that nothing may hinder us in the raising of our selves above the world. Idolaters and Hypocrites, in LIFTING UP THEIR HANDS in prayer, are but Apes, who while they by the outward Symbol professe to have their mindes erected upwards, the first of them sticke in the wood and stone, as if God were inclosed there: the second sort intangled in vaine cares, or wicked cogitations, lye groveling on the earth, and by a contradiction of gesture, beare witnesse against themselves.</p>
        <p>The Ancients are very copious in expressing these outward formes of <em>devotion</em> in the <em>Hands,</em> for they say, the HANDS STRETCHED OUT, PUT FORTH, HOLDEN ABROAD, EXPANSED and ERECTED, and all to imply the naturall <em>piety</em> of the <em>Hand</em> in this expression.

         <em>Cresollius</em> sayes, that this deportment of our <em>Hands</em> declares that <em>we affectionately fly unto the protection of God our heavenly</em> Father. Even as little children disabled by some fright with stretcht out Hands run into the lap of their parents: or as men in the midst of shipwracke stretch out their <em>Hands</em> to some friendly Saviour. For, since the force of this <em>Organum organorum,</em> the <em>Hand,</em> the most excellent instrument of common life doth chiefly consist in three things, in <em>Giving, Doing,</em> and <em>Repelling,</em> who LIFTS UP HIS HANDS seems wholy to <em>deliver</em> and <em>commit himself and all that he is into the sacred power of the Godhead,</em> as if with <em>David</em> he had his soule in his <em>Hand:</em> from the <em>Right-hand</em> of <em>Charity,</em> and the <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 109. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

         <em>Left-hand</em> of <em>Zeale,</em> both joyn'd together to make their intentions more acceptable, as from the living censer or incense-pan of prayer, there ascends, in a sweet kind of articulated silence, the speaking savour of these significations.</p>
        <p>O <em>Parent of the World! God, the maker of all things! this soule, all that I am, a thousand times due to thy majesty and gracious Goodnesse, I render and refer to its Fountaine and Originall.

Gifts, <em>and by wicked machinations</em> repelled <em>and throwne them from mee. Behold my Hands! which it thou please command to be bound, and mee, an unworthy Traytor, (who have sinn'd with a high hand) to be drawne to punishment; who had not liv'd, unlesse Thou hadst lent mee life; which I have abus'd, and rebelliously stretched out my Hand against Thee, to my owne destruction, and the reproach and dishonour of Thy Name.</em> All these significant expressions (as <note place="margin">Cresoll. in Mystag. lib. 3.</note>
         <em>Cresollius</em> hath happily observ'd) are contain'd in this Gesture.</p>
        <p>S. <em>Augustine</em> very elegantly and sweetly gives us the retionality and religious conveniency of this manuall expression. When men in prayer <note place="margin">S. Aug. de cura pro mort. lib. 5.</note> STRETCHT OUT THEIR HANDS, or use any visible expressions, they doe that which is agreeable to the case of a <em>suppliant,</em> although their invisible will &amp; intention of their heart be known to God; neither doth hee stand in need of such declarations that the minde of man should bee laid open before him: but by this gesture man doth more rouze up himselfe to <em>pray</em> and <em>groane</em> more humbly and fervently: And I know not how, whereas these motions of the body cannot be done, unlesse the inward motions of the mind precede, the same thing againe being made externally visible, that interiour invisible which caused them is increased, and by this the affection of the heart, which preceded as the cause before the effect, for so much as they are done, doth encrease. And indeed this outward addition or adjunct of <em>Piety,</em> the OPENING and LIFTING UP OF THE HANDS is a naturall manifestation of the <em>uprightnesse</em> and <em>integrity</em> of the heart, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110295:27"/>
of the <em>sincerity</em> of the affections. For deceit naturally hath no wil, though hypocrisie sometimes may affect to dilate and extend the <em>Hand.</em> And the sympathy is so strong betweene the <em>Heart</em> and the <em>Hand,</em> that a holy thought can no sooner inlarge the erected Heart, but it workes upon the <em>Hands</em> which are RAISED to this expression, and EXTENDED OUT TO THE UTTERMOST OF THEIR CAPACITIES. Upon this naturall motion or exposition of the minde, Saint <em>Chrysostome</em> sets a morall glosse. This LIFTING UP OF OUR HANDS should put us in mind to take heed <note place="margin">S. Chrys. Moral.</note> of sin, lest we defile our <em>Hands</em> therewith. Since it is very absurd, that those who are to bee the Trouchmen and Interpretours of prayer and divine administrations, should also be the instruments of wickednesse: for if we say it is not honest for a man to pray with dirty and unwashen <em>Hands;</em> how much more naughtinesse will that expression be tainted with, to LIFT UP HANDS not dirty, but defiled with the pollutions of sin. And in this sense washing of <em>Hands</em> was used by most Nations before prayer. This <em>Manuall of Prayer</em> as a helpe <em>at Hand,</em> the Christians in all ages have diversly used for the furthering their <em>devotion,</em> as may be collected out of the Ecclesiasticall records of Time. <em>Tertullian</em> renders a <note place="margin">Tertul. de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

          </gap>rat.</note> reason thereof thus: Christians <em>pray</em> with SPREAD OUT HANDS, because our <em>Hands</em> are <em>harmlesse;</em> bare-headed, because we are not ashamed; and without a monitor, because we pray from the breast. For the most part they LIFTED TH<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
          <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>M UP. Which <em>Tertullian</em> would have modestly done, not as mad-men who pray <em>Hand over Head.</em> For this grave Father reporting and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:110295:27"/>
praising the modesty and humility of the Primitive Christians, hath left this caution for a rule in prayer: Adoring with <em>modestie</em> and <em>humilitie,</em> we doe more commend our <em>prayers</em> to God, not so much as our <em>Hands</em> more loftily held up, but temperately and honestly erected. Sometimes Christians did not indeed lift up their <em>Hands</em> on high, but did EXTEND THEM OUT HERE AND THERE into the figure of Christs suffering. Hence in a Medall of <em>Gordian</em> the godly, there is <note place="margin">Pierius in Hieroglyp.</note> an Image LIFTING UP THE SPREAD OUT HANDS TO HEAVEN, with this inscription fitted to the device, <em>Piet as Augusta.</em> And <em>Eusebius</em>
         <note place="margin">Euseb. de vit. Const. lib. 4 c. 15.</note> hath left a memoriall, that <em>Constantine</em> was wont to be figur'd in Coines and painted Tables with his HANDS HOLDEN ABROAD, and his eyes lift up to Heaven, which he calls <em>The habit and composition of Prayer.</em> Doctor <em>Donne</em> in reference to the Symbolicall signification of the Gesture calls it <em>Constantines</em> Catechisticall Coyne.</p>

         </gap>: All this (saith he) perchance therefore especially, that this LIFTING UP OF THE HANDS brings them into our sight, then we can see them, and see whether they be cleane, or no; and consider, that if we see impurity in our <em>Hands,</em> God sees impurity in our prayer. Can we thinke to receive ease from God with that <em>Hand</em> that oppresses another? mercy from God with that <em>Hand</em> that exercises cruelty upon another? or bounty from God with that <em>Hand</em> that with-holds right from another? And to adde by a little enlarging his owne words in another place. How can we expect God should open with his <em>Hands</em> of benediction, who shut up our <em>Hands,</em> and that which is due to another, in them? How much more then, if we strike with those <em>Hands</em> by oppression, or (as <em>Esaiah)</em> we lift up the bloudy <em>Hands</em> of cruelty.</p>
        <p>At this day the common habit of praying in the Church, is, as pertaining to the <em>Hands,</em> TO IOYN THE HANDS, MODERATELY LIFT THEM up, or religiously cut them by ten parts into the forme of the letter X, holding them in that manner before the breast: which manner of prayer <em>Cresollius</em> calls <em>Manus decussatas.</em> In the Romish Church which doth superabound in the externall adjuncts of <em>Devotion,</em> and where the Rubriques direct to varying formes of manuall expressions at the word <em>Oremus,</em> there is alwayes annexed some emphaticall behaviour of the <em>Hand.</em> Hence in the Masse when the Priest saith <em>Oremus,</em> hee EXTENDETH, and then IOYNS HIS HANDS. By the extension of his <em>Hands</em> he gathereth as it were the hearts of the people: by the joyning of his <em>Hands</em> together, he doth amasse them into
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:110295:28"/>
one; which is the glosse of <em>Huelamus</em> upon this <note place="margin">Huelamus de cerem. Missae.</note> Romish rite. The many gesticulations of the <em>Hands</em> and <em>Fingers</em> so ceremoniously troublesome in the Masse, whose mysterious senses <em>Bellarmine, Durandus in ritibus Ecclesiae,</em> and <em>Gavantus</em> in his large Comment upon their Rubriques, hath so copiously explained, was one thing that made the Masse so uneasie to bee said of old by the <em>Hands</em> of every Sir <em>Iohn,</em> as requiring one very well trained up in their Schoole of divine complements.</p>
        <p>This is the <em>Manuall of Prayer,</em> and <em>Practice of Picty,</em> commended by Nature unto us, as a faithfull assistant to our private devotions; which expressed in one of the most significant Dialects of the generall language of the Body, is more vocall and effectuall, then the explications of the Tongue; and more religiously true to the soule in case of extremity, which is manifest by their use in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>his Christian exercise, when the voice cannot expresse or performe her office: for, the <em>Hand</em> inabled by Nature to supply the defect of a <em>vocall Interpretour,</em> hath continued the act of prayer, and presented many visible petitions to the eye of Compassion, which understands the groaning Gestures and dumb ejaculations of the <em>Hand.</em> And this is often observed in religious men, in extremity of sicknesse, whose <em>Hands</em> in the time of health having beene used to accompany and exhibit their requests to heaven, as the last service they can doe the soule and body, offer themselves in this <em>Evening Sacrifice</em> of life. To passe by common instances, it is reported of that learned and reverend Doctor of our Church, that <note place="margin">B.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:110295:29"/>
this reasonable service God requires at our <em>Hands;</em> and toward the time of his dissolution, his <em>Hands</em> were never empty of <em>prayer;</em> and when he could <em>pray</em> no longer <em>voce,</em> with his voice, yet <em>manibus &amp; oculis,</em> by LIFTING UP THE HANDS and eyes, hee <em>prayed</em> still: and when weaknesse and necessity of Nature had excluded these externall accidents of devotion, the <em>Hands</em> and voyce failing in their function, with his heart he prayed still, as was perceived in him by some outward tokens.</p>

        <p>TO WRING THE HANDS is a naturall expression  of <em>excessive griefe,</em> used by those who <em>condole, bewaile,</em> and <em>lament.</em> Of which Gesture that elegant Expositour of Nature hath <note place="margin">Franc. L. Verulam Nat. Hist.</note> assign'd this reason. Sorrow which diminisheth the body it affects, provokes by wringing of the minde, teares, the sad expressions of the eyes; which are produced and caused by the contraction of the spirits of the Braine, which contraction doth straine together the moisture of the Braine, constraining thereby teares into the eyes; from which compression of the Braine proceeds the HARD WRINGING OF THE HANDS, which is a Gesture of expression of moysture. This COMPECTINATION or WEEPING CROSSE of the <em>Hand,</em> is elegantly described by <em>Apulcius,</em> in these words, <em>Palmulis inter alternas digitorum vicissitudines super genua connexis,</em>
         <note place="margin">Apulcius lib. 3. Miles.</note>
         <em>sic grabatum cessim insidens ubertim flebam.</em> Where, as <em>Cresollins</em> observes, hee hath rightly conjoyned this Gesture of the <em>Hands</em> with <em>weeping</em> and <em>teares.</em> For 'tis the declaration of a mind <em>languishing for grief,</em> and <em>almost spent, and wearied

Wee reade that when <em>Heliodorus</em> that <note place="margin">Ammian.

The originall word in the fore part of the verse, properly signifies the <em>bowing of the Hand:</em> because <em>deceit</em> is <em>hollow,</em> and 'tis with the <em>hollow of the Hand</em> that the sleights of deceit are practised.

They thought it also witchcraft but to sit by one that had a practicall designe upon health by the receit of any medicine, either inwardly or outwardly appli'd. Nay, they thought this posture was of force (alone) to hinder such who were in labour, and did then need <em>Lucina's Hand,</em> and that such could not bee delivered as long as any one present held the <em>Hands</em> thus mutually inwrapped: which piece of forcery was the worser, in case the party did hold them about one or both his knees.

notice of most of the expressions of this gesture of the <em>Hand.</em> That it is significant in the six first senses, may bee collected out of many ancient Writers. Thus <em>Memnius Regulus</em> the Consull, in the Senate and presence of the Senatours, <em>called Sejanus</em> unto him. For thus <em>Dion</em> sets it downe.  <em>[Inclamans] <note n="*" place="margin">Dion Cass<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Tiberio.</note> manu portenta, Sejane [ades hue.]</em> And <em>Cyrus</em> when any of his friends were seene crowding towards him, as <em>Xenophon</em>  hath recorded it, <note n="*" place="margin">Xenoph: de Inst.

         <em>protensa manu [eos accersebat.]</em> The same gesture of <em>invitation Ahasuerus</em> used to <em>Esther,</em> when he signified her comming was according to his will. Wisedome also cloathes <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 24</note> her words in the language of this gesture. Because I have <em>called,</em> &amp; ye refused, I have STRETCHED OUT MY HAND, and none would regard. The Psalmist acknowledges himselfe to have used this gesture. I have <em>called</em> upon Thee. I have <note place="margin">Psal. 88. 9.</note> STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS UNTO THEE. ¶ This <em>indicative</em> gesture of the <em>Hand</em> our Savior used to <em>direct</em> and <em>instruct</em> the Jewes who were <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 49.</note> his brethren, when STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND to his Disciples, he said, Behold my mother, and my brethren. ¶ <em>Flavius Flaccus</em> made <note place="margin">Plutarch in the life of Tiberius and Caius.</note> use of this <em>warning</em> gesture of the <em>Hand</em> instead of speech; for when <em>Mutius</em> began to call the Tribes of the people to give their voices for the establishing of some new lawes, propounded by <em>Tiberius Gracchus,</em> in favour of the people, and he could not proceed according to accustomed order in the like case, for the great noise the hindermost made, thrusting forward, and being driven backe, and one mingling with the other; in the meane time <em>Flavius Flaccus</em> one of the Senatours, got up into a place where all the people
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:110295:37"/>
might see him, and when he saw his voice could not be heard of <em>Tiberius,</em> hee made a signe with his <em>Hand</em> that hee had some matter of great importance to tell him. <em>Tiberius</em> [who soone understood this gesture of his <em>Hand,]</em> bade them make a lane through the preasse. So with much adoe <em>Flavius</em> came at length unto him, and bewray'd a conspiracy against him. ¶ <em>Valentinian</em>
         <note place="margin">Ammian. Marcellin lib. 20.</note> with good successe used this gesture of <em>pacification</em> and <em>rebuke,</em> when hee was pronounced before the whole Army Soveraigne Ruler of the Empire. For when hee addressed himselfe to make a premeditated speech, as he PUT FORTH HIS ARME <em>that he might speake more readily,</em> there arose a great mumbling that <em>out of Hand</em> there might a second Emperor be declared w<hi rend="sup">th</em> him: <em>Valentinian</em> fearing to what the Souldiers confident boldnes might prove, HOLDING UP HAPPILY HIS RIGHT HAND, as a most <em>hardy</em> and <em>redoubted</em> Prince, daring to <em>rebuke</em> some of them as seditious and stubborne, delivered his minde without interruption of any. The Emperour having ended his speech, which an unexpected <em>authority</em> had made more confident, <em>appeared</em> them, and won them all to his minde; which was to choose his companion: who took afterwards unto him to be Colleague in the Empire, his brother <em>Valens.</em> ¶ That this gesture is significant to <em>protect</em> appeares by most passages of holy Writ, intimating the <em>powerfull</em> and <em>gracious protection</em> of God. Where the expressions by an <em>Anthropopeia</em> are taken from this gesture. Thus God having put <em>Moses</em> in the cleft of the rocke, <em>covered</em> him with his <em>Hand</em> while he passed by. And 'tis <em>Noverinus</em>
         <note place="margin">Exod. 33. 23.</note>

         <em>Caph</em> signifies both the <em>Hand,</em> or the hollownesse of the <em>Hand,</em> and a cloud. Hence <em>Pagninus</em> turns <em>protegam te manu mea,</em> into <em>operiam te nube mea:</em> a good coherens, saith he, <em>manus &amp; nubis nexus.</em> In this sense that of the Prophet <em>Isaiah</em> is to bee <note place="margin">Isa. 49. 2.</note> taken, Under the <em>shadow</em> of his <em>Hand</em> hath he hid me. That is, he hath taken me into his <em>protection</em> and <em>defence.</em> And the Metaphors of an OUTSTRETCHED ARME and HIGH HAND are very frequent in Scripture to shadow out the <em>powerfull protection</em> of God in the two degrees of it, the <em>ordinary</em> and <em>extraordinary.</em> For in this representation of <em>power,</em> there is the <em>Hand,</em> and the Arme, the <em>mighty Hand,</em> and out STRETCHED ARME; two degrees of <em>power,</em> both great, but one greater: that of the <em>Hand</em> is great, but ordinary; that of the Arme is greater, and commeth forth but upon extraordinary occasions, every thing we put not to the Armes end. And their <em>Hands</em> are properly said to be <em>shortned,</em> that have lost the <em>power</em> to <em>save</em> and <em>protect;</em> a phrase much used in holy Writ by the Prophets speaking in His Name who made the <em>Hand,</em> the naturall Hieroglyphique <note place="margin">Isa. 50. 2. 59. 1.

        <p>TO LIFT UP THE RIGHT HAND TO HEAVEN, is the naturall forme and ceremony of  an <em>oath,</em> used by those who <em>call God to witnesse,</em> and would <em>adjure, confirme,</em> or <em>assure by the obligation of an oath.</em> An expression first used by the <em>Hands</em> of the ancient Patriarchs, and is thought to have flowed from God himselfe, who in many places of holy Writ is brought in speaking of himselfe, to have used this gesture for <note place="margin">Thus Ex. 6. 8.

         <em>confirmation of his gracious promises</em> by the outward solemnity of an oath.

          </gap>ath.</em> There is a passage in the prophesie of the Prophet <em>Daniel</em>

        <head>Suffragor Gest. XIX</head>
        <p>TO HOLD UP THE HAND is a naturall token of <em>approbation, consent, election,</em> and of  giving <em>suffrage.</em> An expression of the <em>Hand</em> so common, that <em>Chirotonia</em> which properly is this gesture of the <em>Hand,</em> is usurped <em>per metalepsin connexi pro suffragio.</em> To this declaration of the <em>Hand</em> that elegant metaphor of the Prophet <em>Zephanie</em> is referred: The deepes made a noise, and LIFT UP THEIR HANDS ON HIGH, that is, shewed <note place="margin">Zephan. 3. 10.</note> signes of their <em>obedience</em> and <em>voluntary inclination,</em> as by LIFTING UP THEIR HANDS. And when <em>Esàras</em> blessed God, the people LIFTING UP THEIR HANDS, to their audible, added a <note place="margin">Esdras. 1. cap 9. 47.</note> kinde of visible <em>Amen,</em> signed by this gesture of <em>assent,</em> which is as much in the language of the <em>Hand</em> as <em>So be it. Tully</em> makes mention of this expression: If those Decrees that are received <note place="margin">Cicero pro Flacco</note> be rightly expressed, and singular excellent; not declared so by judgements nor authorities, nor
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:110295:41"/>
bound by an oath, but by HOLDING UP THE HAND, and with great acclamation of the affected multitude. Hence both the phrase and practice of this gesture of <em>approbation</em> so frequently occurres in <em>Xenophons</em> Orations, who having made a proposition to the people, To whom <note place="margin">Xenoph. de Cyr. minor. exped. l. 3. &amp; 4.</note>
         <em>this seemes good</em> (saith he) let him HOLD UP HIS HAND, and all of them HELD UP THEIR HANDS. At the end of which Oration <em>Chirisophus</em> approving what <em>Xenophon</em> had said, requires the same expression at the peoples <em>Hands</em> in the same phrase, saying, He who approves of these things, let him signifie his <em>assent</em> by HOLDING UP HIS HAND. Then all of them HELD UP THEIR HANDS. And <em>Xenophon</em> arising againe to speake, concludes thus: Who <em>assents</em> to these things, let him HOLD UP HIS HAND, which they did accordingly. And so in many other places of his Oration. The signification of suffrage in this gesture may be further illustrated by the practice of the Athenians in that passage of <note place="margin">Thucidides lib. 3.</note>
         <em>Thucidides,</em> where when <em>Cleon</em> and <em>Diotatus</em> had both delivered their opinions, the one most opposite unto the other, about the alteration of the cruell Decree of the Athenians against the Myteleans, the Athenians were at contention which they should decree; and at the holding up of hands they were both sides almost equall.

And this expression doth arise from the same cause that trembling and horrour do; namely <note place="margin">My Lord Bacons Nat. hist. Cent. 8.</note> from the retiring of the spirits, but in a lesse degree. For, the SHAKING OF THE HAND, is but a slow and definite trembling. And is a gesture of <em>slight refusall and dislike,</em> being used often by those who <em>refuse</em> a thing, or <em>warne it away.</em> This was the entertainment <em>Antipater</em> found at the <em>Hands</em> of his Father. For when he <note place="margin">Joseph of the warres of the Jewes.</note> boldly came neare as though he would have saluted him, <em>Herod</em> STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND, and shaking his head, gave him the <em>repulse,</em> taxing his presumption, for daring to offer to embrace him, when he was guilty of so many treacheries against him. ¶ As it is a gesture that naturally without speech <em>forbids,</em> it was used by <em>Augustus,</em> when with his countenance and <em>Hand</em> he <em>repressed</em> those unseemly flatteries which <note place="margin">Suet.

Nothing more ordinary in the occurrences of common life then this gesture, practised in these senses, a common custome to <em>bid one keepe on his way,</em> and <em>proceed</em> who is returning to us; to SHAKE OUR HAND as farre as ever we can see, to bid our friends <em>farewell</em> and <em>adieu. Ovid</em> according the ingenious way of invention in Poets, to heighten their fictions, and to set an artificiall glosse of truth upon them, that they may seeme more probable, upon every occasion brings in the personages of his story using these naturall expressions of the <em>Hand.</em> Thus he brings in <em>June</em>

If we should goe over the Chronicles of all ages, and trace this naturall gesture of the <em>Hand</em> through those records which beare witnesse of times and the manners of men; we should meet with many examples of this <em>angry</em> expression of the <em>Hand.</em> Some few copies of this originall affection will serve to confirme and illustrare the acception of this gesture, in this sense, and signification. Thus <em>Leo Armenus</em> Emperour entring into the prison <note place="margin">Zonaras.</note> by night, and seeing <em>Michael Balbus,</em> and the Warden of the prison with him, and almost asleep, <em>declared his anger</em> by the AGITATION OF HIS HAND. <em>Papias</em> the Warden fearing the <em>anger</em> of the Emperour, in conclusion conspired with the same <em>Michael,</em> and on the very night of the nativity of our Saviour slew the Emperour. Thus the Souldiers of <em>Vitellius</em> Army BENT <note place="margin">Tacit. hist. lib. 1.</note> THEIR FISTS against the Ambassadours of the Helvetians, who came to treat that their City might not be razed, which the Souldiers <em>(gréedy of revenge)</em> had importunately called for to be razed, and <em>Vitellius</em> for his part spared no <em>threats.</em> Thus the Senate BENT THEIR FISTS against <em>Sarielenus Vocula,</em> and ceased not to <em>offer violence</em> untill he had departed the house.

        <p>TO HOLD OUT THE HAND HOLLOW IN  MANNER OF A DISH, is their habit who <em>crave, beg, covet,</em> and <em>shew a gréedy readinesse to receive;</em> and there is a certaine forme or semblance of the thing implied, in this unusuall capacity of the <em>Hand.</em> From the naturall signification of this posture, that biting adage had its originall which taxeth the <em>lucrativs gréedinesse,</em> of the Athenians; <em>Atheniensis, vel moriens, <note n="*" place="margin">Eras. Adag.</note> cavat manum.</em> This gesture of <em>receit</em> to an ingenious and honest man hath been accounted a kinde of <em>reproach,</em> as appeares by the witty saying of <em>Julian</em> the Emperour.

Yet <em>covetousnesse</em> hath bowed the <em>Hands</em> even of Emperours to the significant practice thereof. For <em>Suetonius</em> reports that <em>Octavius</em>

         <em>Augustus Caesar,</em> by occasion of a vision by night, <em>begged</em> yearly upon a certaine day money of the people, and HELD OUT HIS HAND HOLLOW to those who brought him brazen dodkins, or mites, called <em>Asses.</em> And the same Author hath observed as much in <em>Vespasian,</em> who was so <note place="margin">Idem Vespasiano.</note> famous for raising profit out of his Subjects urine and his <em>dulcis odor lucri ex re qualibet.</em> For when certaine Ambassadours brought him word that there was decreed for him at the common charges of thè state a Giant-like image that hee would cost no meane summe of money, he commanded to raise the same immediately, SHEWING therewith HIS HAND HOLLOW.

        <p>TO PUT FORTH THE RIGHT HAND  SPREAD, is the habit of <em>bunty, liberality,</em> and a <em>frée heart;</em> thus we <em>reward</em> and <em>friendly bestow our guists.</em> Hence TO OPEN THE HAND

          </gap>cent,</em> and <em>liberall.</em> For, the Hebrewes when they would expresse a <em>profuse munificence,</em> they say <em>Jadpethucha,</em> that is, <em>Manum apertàm:</em>
         <note place="margin">Leunclavius Hist. Mussel. lib. 4. Ecclesiast. 40. 14.</note> from whence perchance the Turkes borrowing the conceit, are wont to set forth <em>Liberality</em> by an OPEN HAND. The sonne of <em>Sirach</em> knowing that the exercise of Bounty and Prodigality requires in a manner the like gesture and expression of the <em>Hand;</em> speaking of the unjust spend-thrift wasting of his goods, saith, That while he OPENETH HIS HAND he shall rejoyce. And the Greekes in old time (saith <em>Pliny)</em> called the <em>span,</em> or <em>space of the Hand from the thumb to the little fingers</em>
         <note place="margin">Plin. Nat. Hist.</note>
         <em>end, Doron,</em> which is the reason that <em>gifts</em> be in their language called <em>Dora,</em> because they bee <em>presented</em> with the <em>Hand.</em> Hence Phisiognomists say such who customarily use to hold the <note place="margin">☞</note>
         <em>Hand</em> extended out are of a liberall complexion of minde; arguing from this liberall property of the <em>Hand.</em> And there is a tradition our Midwives have concerning children borne OPEN HANDED, that such will prove of a <em>bountifull disposition,</em> and <em>franke-handed.</em> Infants indeed for the most part come into the world with their <em>Hands clos'd;</em> thereby notifying, as a Rabbi observes, <note place="margin">Buxtorph.</note> that God hath given them the riches of this world, and as it were shut them up in their <em>Hands:</em> whereas on the contrary, dying men are wont to EXTEND AND STRETCH OUT THEIR HANDS AND FINGERS, thereby willing to signifie that they <em>relinquish</em> the world, and have no longer to doe with the things thereof. Which is the only good action the <em>close-handed</em> Miser doth, who when death opens and unlockes his <em>Hand,</em>
         <pb n="63" facs="tcp:110295:46"/>
doth by this necessary posture of <em>bounty, give away</em> and <em>bequeath,</em> and as it were <em>manumit</em> what he could no longer with-hold from the next possessor. <em>Bellarmine</em> relates a story of <em>Stephen</em> King <note place="margin">Bellarm. in vit. S. Stophani.</note> of Hungary, whose <em>Hand</em> was found whole and uncorrupt after his death. And casting in his minde what might be the reason why God was pleased miraculously to preserve his <em>Right Hand</em> onely, with the skinne, bones, and nerves, when the other members were resolved into their first elements, delivers his opinion, thus: Truly I thinke that in this miracle God was willing to shew the depth of his divine councell, that <em>charity</em> excells all other vertues. Deservedly therefore did the <em>Right Hand</em> of this holy King remain uncorrupt, which was alwayes flourishing with the blossomes of <em>mercy,</em> and which in <em>relieving</em> and <em>distributing gifts</em> to the poore, was never empty or indisposed. God (indeed) who OPENS' WITH HIS HAND, and filleth every living thing with his blessings, out of his infinite <em>bounty</em> deales out liberally his divine Almes to his creatures with both his <em>Hands.</em> Whence Divines distinguish the <em>gifts</em> of God into those of his <em>Right Hand,</em> and those of his <em>Left,</em> to wit, into <em>spirituall</em> and <em>temporall. Dextra Dei est unde grata proveniunt.</em> Hence the <em>Aramites</em> by a <em>Right Hand</em> understand the <em>effuse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

          </gap>enignity</em> of God. <em>Maldonat</em>
         <note place="margin">Maldonat. Comment in Mat. 6.</note> commenting upon the words of our Saviour, <em>Let not thy left Hand know what thy right Hand doth,</em> gives a reason why in this place, contrary to the enstome of Scripture, the <em>Left Hand</em> is named before the <em>Right,</em> and action attributed to the <em>Right Hand,</em> and knowledge to the <em>Left.</em> For it is therefore done (saith hee) because wee are
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:110295:47"/>
wont to reach out our <em>almes</em> (which our Saviour there speakes of) with our <em>Right Hand,</em> hence called <em>Manus eleemosinaria,</em> and not with our <em>left,</em> and al other works that are done with the <em>Hand,</em> the <em>Right Hand</em> does them the <em>Left</em> as a helper doth assist; so that if it had eyes it could not bee ignorant what the <em>Right Hand</em> did: wherefore Christ would have us so to exercise this <em>Hand</em> with workes of <em>charity,</em> that our <em>Left Hand</em> (which is wont to be not onely conscious, but accessory to all the actions of the <em>Right Hand,)</em> should not so much as know or take notice thereof. <em>Cresollius</em> judiciously scanning these words of our Saviour, <em>Let not thy left Hand know what thy</em>
         <note place="margin">Cresol. Anthol. Sacr.</note>
         <em>right Hand doth,</em> tells us that it is a symbolicall expression very like to the Hieroglyphiques of the Aegyptians, and therefore the force and sense of this admonition, is to be sought out of the nature and usuall signification of both the <em>Hands.</em> As for the <em>Right Hand,</em> it is altogether OPEN, <em>free,</em> and manifestly put in action. Wherefore for its part it denotes an ingenuous candor and virtue, whose glory is most perspicuously set out by action; but more especially the <em>Right Hand</em> signifieth <em>liberality,</em> and for that cause chosen to bee the hieroglyphique of a most <em>beneficent</em> and <em>plentifull largesse:</em> whereas the <em>Left Hand</em> hath a contrary Genius, and is observed to be of a close and retired nature: this <em>Niggard</em> out of a skulking disposition affecting secresie, and the subtile leisure of a thrifty vacation. So that this Symboll of our Saviour insinuates thus much: If thou art disposed to communicate thy goods to relieve the wants of thy brother, and to shew forth the <em>liberality</em> of thy minde, take not counsell of thy
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:110295:47"/>
         <em>Left Hand:</em> minde not what the covetous desire of goods, and the thirst of having, require at thy <em>griping Hand;</em> let the <em>Right Hand</em> prevaile with thee, the index of <em>beneficence,</em> and pledge of <em>commiseration,</em> the <em>accuser of covetousnesse.</em> Let that muck-worme the <em>Left Hand</em> earth it selfe in avarice, and keepe silence by an uncharitable retention, which doth not love to scatter, but to snatch away; not to <em>bestow,</em> but a long time to <em>retaine.</em> How many <em>Scaevola</em>'s or <em>Left-handed</em> Donatists in matter of bounty doe our times afford, within the frozen hold of whose sparing <em>Hand</em> Charity is quite starv'd with cold? And how many who fearing the Moralists <em>Bis dat qui cito dat,</em> with the old Courtiers glosse, that the sooner suiters are dispatched, the sooner they will returne againe: by sinister delay hold them in suspence, while their courtesies hang to their fingers ends like Bird-lime, and will not come away?

         <em>favours.</em> These men, as if they were restrained by some <em>sumptuary Law,</em> made against the naturall munificence of the <em>Right Hand,</em> refer all matters of beneficence to the penurious discretion of the <em>Left Hand.</em> Nay, are there not some, who as if they held ignorance to bee the mother of thrift, to elude this <em>nesciat</em> of the Gospel, have made their <em>Hands</em> strike a league together, and agree never to know any such thing one by the other?</p>

having beene tooke notice of by ancient Chronologers: for, the <em>Hand</em> according to the primitive intention of Nature, having by a necessary consent of Nations beene ever chosen Chronologer of al remarkable actions, hath consequently proved its own Biographer. If therefore we but cast an intuitive eye upon those memorials the Right <em>Hand</em> of Time hath left fairly noted in the Left Palme of Antiquity, even by the old autography of the <em>Hand,</em> wee may spell out the sense of this naturall expression. For when <em>Valentinian</em> had a full purpose to adorne his sonne <em>Gratian,</em> a pretty young stripling, and <note place="margin">Ammian.

Another Copie of this naturall gesture we finde in the <em>Hand</em> of <em>Pertinax,</em> refusing in modesty the Empire; pretending his age and meane descent: <note place="margin">Herodian. lib. 2.</note> who taking <em>Glabrio</em> by the <em>Hand,</em> and pulling him forth, placed him in the Imperiall Throne, <em>recommending</em> him as more fit for the Empire.

Thus also <em>Tiberius</em> (though with dissimulation) tooke <em>Nero</em> and <em>Drusus, Germanicus</em> children, by the <em>Hands,</em> and <em>recommended</em>
         <note place="margin">Tacitus Annal. l. 3.</note> them to the care of the Senate in a dissembling Oration he made. Thus <em>Cyrus</em> taking

         <note place="margin">Florus Joseph. l. 18. c. 12.</note> proves this expression of the <em>Hand</em> to have been in very great force and virtue among the Ancients. <em>Artabanus</em> (saith he) King of the Parthians, STRETCHING OUT HIS RIGHT HAND <em>swore</em>

Wherefore when he was moved by the master of his Horse that he might kill <em>Asinaeus,</em> he denyed to permit that against a man who had committed himselfe to his <em>Faith con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Thus and thus were my words unto them: and indeed but my words: Mary they had liever heare <em>Gracchus</em> himselfe speake, and heare the same from his owne mouth: they would more gladly talke with him in person, and TAKE HOLDOF HIS RIGHT HAND, which as the <em>assured pawne</em> of his <em>faithfull promise</em> he carryeth alwayes with him wheresoever he goeth, and they desire no more. This may bee further illustrated by another passage of <em>Livic,</em> where <em>Syphax</em>

The King of Persia commanded <note place="margin">Camer. hist. med.</note> his Ambassadours to make this expression in his name. And in the same manner the ancient Emperours and Kings of Germany were wont to send their great men to <em>conclude a peace,</em> and determine affaires, when they could not goe themselves. <em>Apollophanes Cyzicenus,</em> who had in former times beene bound to <em>Pharnabazus</em> by the lawes of Hospitality, and was a guest at that <note place="margin">Xenoph.

Of this language of <em>assurance</em> expressed by the GIVEN HAND, there called <em>Dextra securitatis.</em> The Bookes of the Macchabees are very pregnant. Thus when the 3. thousand Souldiers that <em>Jonathan</em> had sent to <em>Demetrius</em> to Antiochia at his <note place="margin">1 Macch.</note> request, (when the Citizens saw that the Jewes had gotten the <em>upper Hand,</em> and they were disappointed of their purpose of staying their King) made their supplication unto the King, saying, GIVE US THE RIGHT HAND [or <em>grant us peace.]</em> Thus they of Gaza made supplication unto <em>Ionathan,</em> and he GAVE THEM THE RIGHT <note place="margin">1 Macch. 11. 62. 1 Macch. 13. 45.</note> HAND [or <em>made peace with them]</em> When <em>Simon</em> had besieged Beth-sura, and fought against it a long season, and shut it up; at last they desired RIGHT HANDS TO BE GIVEN THEM, to whom GIVING THE RIGHT HAND, &amp;c.

And thus <em>Antiochus Eupater</em> communed with the men in <note place="margin">2 Maccab. 13. 22.</note> Beth-sura, and GAVE AND TOOKE THE RIGHT HAND, [or tooke <em>truce</em> with them.] ¶ The speech of <em>Reuben</em> to his father <em>Jacob</em> about <em>Benjamins</em> delivering into his <em>Hands,</em> hath reference to <note place="margin">Gen. 42. 37.</note> this signification of <em>trust.</em> And that speech of <em>Judah</em> unto his Father about the same busines, I will be surety for him; of my <em>Hand</em> shalt thou require <note place="margin">Gen. 43. 9</note> him. ¶ In the sense of <em>fidelity</em> all the Princes &amp; men of power, and all the sons of <em>David</em> GAVE THE HAND unto King <em>Salomon.</em> And the Prophet <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 24</note>
         <em>Ezekiel</em> emphatically declaring the perjury and infidelity of the King of Jerusalem, who had <note place="margin">Ezek. 17. 18.</note> broken the oath made with the King of Babel, which he had <em>confirmed</em> BY GIVING HIS HAND, denounceth these punishments: That he should dye in the midst of Babel, in the place of the King that had made him King, whose oath hee had despised, and whose covenant made with him he brake: Neither should <em>Pharaoh</em> King of Aegypt in whom he trusted deliver him. For hee hath despised the Oath, and broken the <em>Covenant,</em> YET LOE, HE HAD GIVEN HIS HAND! And verily all Nations have ever had a naturall respect unto the mystery of Faith, which hath her firme existence in the <em>Hand,</em> and have so esteemed the <em>Right Hand,</em> they thought the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:110295:65"/>
touch thereof to be the most lively, significant and expresse <em>pawne</em> or <em>pledge</em> of <em>faithfulnesse:</em> whence all <em>compacts, leagues, Grants, combinations, truces, proviso's, bargaines, covenants,</em> and <em>entercourses</em> whatsoever, are held to be inviolably <em>ratified,</em> and to stand in full power, force, and virtue by the TOUCH of the <em>insuring Hand.</em> For when we GIVE OUR HAND, we doe seal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
          <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> as it were an obligation or reall contract, by which presents we deeply ingage our selves to a punctuall accomplishment of that which our <em>Hand</em> had <em>protested</em> to; the <em>Hand</em> being bound as a surety that our deeds shall bee forth-comming, and be found answerable to our words: for whosoever forfeits the Recognizance of his <em>Hand,</em> he breaks the most sacred and strongest band of of Truth; and by falsifying his manuall faith proves a kinde of Renegado to himselfe. <em>Caelius Rhodiginus</em> thinkes there is some Pythagoricall <note place="margin">Cael. Rho. var. lect.</note> mystery in this authenticke guise of the <em>Hand</em> in <em>warrantizing faithfull dealings,</em> and that the gesture flowes from a secret and religious reverence to that comprehensive number <em>Ten,</em> for while each <em>Hand</em> doth extend five fingers which move to the comprehension of each other, they premit a resemblance of the <em>Decades</em> mystery, since meeting in their formall close they seem to greet one another in that number. <em>Callymachus</em> and <em>Varro</em> endeavour to render another reason, <note place="margin">Callymac. &amp; Varro.</note> drawne from the naturall authority and command that consists in the virtue of the <em>Right Hand.</em> And verily <em>Faith</em> consists wholly in the <em>Right Hand,</em> and the left hath no obligatory force or virtue in it. For to give the left hand, or to take anothers given <em>Right Hand</em> with the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:110295:66"/>
left, is not binding in point of naturall Faith. And therefore when <em>Josippus Gorio</em> the Jew, desired a Roman Souldier to give him his <em>Right</em>
         <note place="margin">Dorleans upon Tacitus.</note>
         <em>Hand</em> in signe of <em>Faith,</em> he gave him his left, and drawing his sword with his <em>Right Hand,</em> slew him; and yet he cannot properly be said to have falsified his promise, since he gave him but his left hand, whose touch hath no assurance, but was ever held deceitfull and ominous. Therefore the oath of Faith in all adjurations was taken and required by the <em>Right Hand.</em> Hence <em>Plautus, Haec per dextram tuam, dextrate retinente manu,</em>
         <note place="margin">Plautus captiv.</note>
         <em>obsecro, infidelior mihi ne sis quam ego sum tibi.</em> To which may be referred that adjuration of <em>Cicero, per dextram ipsam quam hospes hospiti porrexisti.</em>

Hence it is that we may see many ancient coines with two <em>Hands</em> joyned together, with this inscription of Faith kept; <em>Fides Romanorum,</em>
         <note place="margin">Pier. hier. lib. 35.</note> sometimes <em>Fides legionum.</em> And hence also it was that the Romans were wont to contrive the statues of those Princes that had deserved well of the Common-wealth, that by a <em>Right Hand</em> extended out they signified their Faith unto the same. <em>Tully</em> had reference to this Stateoath, when he said, I gave Publicke Faith upon the promise of the Senators, that is to say, he offered forth his <em>Right Hand,</em> as a pledge thereof: and it is fit this naturall ceremony of an oath should be reverenced in the <em>Hand,</em> the chiefest seat of Fidelity, since it is the honest foundation of all right and equity. ¶ Nothing so ordinary in the common affaires of life as STRIKING HANDS, whether it be for confirmation of our bargaines, grants or covenants in the behalfe of our selves, or in undertaking by way of promise

And I have sometimes in consort with my friend had good sport to set him to observe the pure and naturall efforts of these men in the heat of their dealings, and have suffered my selfe to bee a little smitten with the <em>Hand</em> of deceit, to gaine the curiosity of an experiment, a kinde of solace, pleasing to Philosophicall complexions, and such who hunt after the subtleties of Nature: wherein though I cannot brag of my bargain, yet I can afford my Reader a good penniworth. Their cunning mannaging of the <em>Hand</em> in time and tone, I have sometimes call'd the Horse-Rhetorique of Smithfield, which by calculation I have found to differ from the Fish Dialect of Billingsgate, in the monochord of motion, and peaceablenesse of accent.

and selling by this insurance and policy of the <em>Hand.</em>
        </p>
        <p>¶ But as concerning that perillous striking of the <em>Hand</em> for others, <em>Salomon</em> who was well versed in the subtle notions of manuall utterance, acknowledging the signification thereof in suretiship, discommends the inconvenient and obligatory force of this expression: My sonne, if thou <note place="margin">Prov. 6. 1.</note> be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy <em>Hand</em> with a stranger, thou art snared, &amp;c. And in another place: Be not thou of those that strike <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 6</note>
         <em>Hands,</em> or of them that are sureties for debts. And the Wiseman striking again with the same <em>Hand</em> of reprehension: A man void of understanding striketh <em>Hands</em> and becommeth surety in the presence of his friend. Wherein he checkes the indiscreet forwardnesse of some men in these kinde of undertakings, who offer themselves before the favour is required at their <em>Hands,</em> and at the very sight of and presence of his friend, without consideration <note place="margin">Dr. Jerm. mins paraphr. observat. on the Prov.</note> or looking into the businesse, thrusts his <em>Hands</em> into the bond of suretiship. And such a man is here describ'd to bee a man wanting a heart, and surely it were well if such a one were without a <em>Hand</em> also: for since hee hath not understanding in his heart to keep him from hurt, it were good he had no power in his <em>Hand</em> to doe himselfe hurt: especially if he be such a foole, as having strucken anothers <em>Hand,</em> and made himselfe a surety, he striketh his owne <em>Hands</em> as applauding himselfe for it, which may be the sense of this place. Surely such a foole may quickly wring his <em>Hands</em> together in sorrow, who before did clap his <em>Hands</em> in joy, and may strike himselfe in anger with the same <em>Hand</em> wherewith in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:110295:68"/>
the foolish kindnesse of suretiship he strucke the <em>Hand</em> of another. For he that hath strucken his <em>Hand</em> to be surety for his friend, had beene better that his friend had strucke him with a harder blow, when by striking his <em>Hand</em> he hath brought him, under the <em>Hand</em> of another, and <em>behinde hand</em> in the world. <em>Salazar</em> commenting upon these places of the Proverbs, renders this expression of <note place="margin">Salaz. comment. in Prov.

Variously, sometimes 'tis <em>Manum desigere, volam percutere, in fidei jubentibus pro debitis manum pepigere, in fidei jussionibus stipulata manu side jubere.</em> And he calls it sometimes <em>Sonum securitatis vel assecurationis, scil. eum sonum quem in stipulationis, &amp; fideijussionis, seu assecurationis pacto manus manui conserta, &amp; illisa edore solet. Job</em> also, eloquent in affliction, <note place="margin">Job 17. 3.</note> in his appeale from men to God, acknowledgeth the obligatory sense of this expression of the <em>Hand,</em> Lay downe now, put me in a surety with thee; who is hee that will STRIKE HANDS with me? By <em>Tully</em> this solemne bond or obligation of the <em>Hand</em> is called <em>Nexus: Attici, te</em>

in which the Heyre was taken by the <em>Hand</em> that hee might passe into the family of the Testator, and in the buying of servants, but also in all obligatory bargaines and pledges, as <em>Hottoman</em> informes us: and indeed in buying and selling this <em>Nexus</em> was commonly used; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

        <p>¶ That this gesture is significant to <em>licence, warrant,</em> and <em>assure,</em> is not difficult to prove. For thus <em>Artaxerxes</em> King of Persia by giving his Right <em>Hand</em> to <em>Mithridates</em> the brother of <em>Ariobarzane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

         </em> while they <em>willingly</em> EMBRACE EACH OTHERS HAND signifie
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:110295:70"/>
that <em>they are both content that their works shall be common;</em> by this gesture speaking plainly, as if they in effect should say, <em>What damage happens unto thée, I shall esteeme as my owne losse;</em> and thy <em>emolument and profit I shall entertaine as mine owne, and thou shalt finde me ready prest with a consonant and willing minde, both to yéeld to thée a share of my welfare, and reciprocally to beare a part of thy calamity.</em> For, all this is the more significantly implied by this gesture, in regard, that <em>works</em> are the <em>words</em> of <em>love;</em> and the <em>Hand</em> is the Tongue of <em>hearty goodwill.</em> The minde of man naturally desirous by some symbole or sententious gesture to utter and disclose herselfe in the affections of <em>love,</em> doth manifestly set forth her disposition by this <em>courtly</em> declaration of the <em>Hand,</em> a naturall <em>complement</em> where with she commonly sweetens her <em>affectionate respects</em> to others. And this naturall expression seems to result from the sympathy between the will and the <em>Hand:</em> for, the will affectionately inclined and moved to stretch forth her selfe, the <em>Hand,</em> that is moved by the same spirit, willing to goe out and set a glosse upon the inward motion, casts it selfe into a forme extending to a semblance of the inward appetite; neither is the <em>Hand</em> at any time found too short for such an expression if the will be disposed to cooperate with it. For, nature who hath ingeniously thought on many conveniences of expression for the use and benefit of common life, among others, seems to have ordained the <em>Hand</em> to be the generall instrument of the minde, and endued it with a <em>courteous</em> appetite of closing with anothers. Therefore when the minde
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:110295:70"/>
would disclose the virtue, strength, and forcible operation of her <em>favour</em> and <em>good-will,</em> out of the abundance of her <em>love</em> she puts forth the <em>Hand,</em> and in that as it were the <em>heart</em> it self, with <em>affectionate love;</em> and receives them againe by a naturall bill of exchange in the <em>Hand</em> of another, which verily is a signe of <em>mutuall agréement,</em> and of a <em>perfect conjunction;</em> for which cause <em>Pindarus</em> a Poet of an aspiring wit, placed the heart <note place="margin">Pindarus</note> and <em>Hand</em> as relatives under one and the same parallel. To the naturall sense of this gesture appertains divers passages of <em>Tacitus:</em> The Lingones <note place="margin">Tacit. hist. lib. 1.</note> (saith he) according to their accustomed manner had sent gifts to the Legions <em>right Hands</em> in token of mutuall love and hospitality. The Centurion <em>Sisenna</em> carried in the name of the Syrian Army to the Souldiers of the guard <em>right Hands</em> in token of concord. And Ambassadours came from <em>Artabanus</em> King of the Parthians, calling to minde their friendship and allyance with the Romans, and desiring to <em>reni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
           <desc>•</desc>
          </gap>e Right Hands.</em> To bring this important gesture of the <em>Hand</em> in <em>friendship</em> a little nearer to the authenticke light of sacred History. So <em>John</em> to <em>Jona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

        <p>¶ That this gesture is significant in <em>salutation, bidding welcome</em> and <em>entertainment,</em> is apparent by many testimonies of the Ancients. <em>Virgil</em> in the first place witnesseth the same, complaining <note place="margin">Virg. Aeneld. 8.</note> to his mother, thus,

This symbolicall expression of the <em>Hand</em> had a practicall signification among the Ancients, when the <em>Hand</em> given did <em>assure the inviolable observation of all the lawes of hospitality,</em> which may receive some illustration from the noble practice of <em>Pacuvius Calavius,</em> who when <note place="margin">Liv. l. 23.</note> he had invited <em>Annibal</em> to supper, and <em>Perolla</em> his onely sonne after supper had told his father that he had now an opportunity to reconcile himselfe unto the Romanes, to let him seale it with the blood of <em>Annibal;</em> His father dehorting and conjuring him from the violation of the lawes of hospitality &amp; breach of covenant: There are not many houres past since that we sware by all the gods and holy hollowes in heaven, and by IOYNING HAND IN HAND made <em>faithfull promise</em> and <em>obliged</em> our selves to communicate together with him, &amp; so to eat at the holy Table of sacred Viands, &amp;c.

[which more wrought upon him] when he remembred withall and called to minde, the <em>hospitable entertainment,</em> the GIVING INTERCHANGEABLY OF THE RIGHT HAND, and the <em>covenant</em> betweene them, made both in publique and private. Our Ancestors also had this expression of <em>Hospitable love</em> in a reall respect, when they knew no greater terme of reproach, then to call a man unhospitable. This expression of the <em>Hand</em> continues in force and estimation, and beares such sway among all Nations (especially those that are Northward) that he seemes to be disarmed of all humanity, and to want the affability of expression, who doth (when there is occasion for it) omit this <em>benevolent insinuation</em> of the <em>Hand.</em> But concerning this familiar and naturall intimation of the <em>Hand</em> in point of <em>salutation,</em> the ancient Sages and men of soundest judgement, have made a quaere whether the <em>familiar</em> contact bee so comely and laudable in the <em>Hand</em> of a prudent and religious man. Among the wise Masters, those who were given to pleasure, as <em>Socrates, Plato,</em> and others, willingly <note place="margin">Cresollius Mystag. vol. 1.</note> admit of this embracing of the <em>Hand,</em> as an <em>allurement</em> to uncleane desire. But those that affected gravity, disallowed the promiscuous use thereof. Verily the Pythagoreans did give the <em>Right Hand</em> to none but men of their owne Sect, no not so much as to any of the same family, unlesse to their Parents, as <em>Iamblicus</em> notes. And it <note place="margin">Iamblicus</note> appears by the most ancient observations of elder times, that holy men for the most part used in their <em>salutations</em> only to put forth the <em>Hand;</em> since so, the <em>singular benevolence</em> of a <em>friendly</em> minde may be expressed without any impeachment to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:110295:72"/>
their virtue and gravity. <em>Meletius</em> of Antioch, a man endued with an incredible <em>easinesse and swéetnesse of manners,</em> and most deare to all good men, is said only to have put forth his affable and gracious <em>Right Hand</em> in <em>salutations,</em> to shew the force of his <em>love</em> and <em>affection</em> towards others, wherein he observed the lawes of common humanity, and a <em>courteous disposition,</em> without any detriment to religious modesty. And at this day religious men in forreigne parts most commonly abstaine from embracing the <em>Hands</em> of others, without incurring the censure of incivility, and want of grace in behaviour, as taking the shaking of <em>Hands</em> in this sense, to be too <em>blunt</em> an expression for a <em>Hand</em> accustomed to matters of decorum, and the sacred tokens of divine reverence. ¶ In signe of <em>congratulation</em> the Huntsmen at the fall of the Boore slaine by <em>Meleager</em> with cheerfull shouts unfolding their joyes shake his victorious <em>Hands,</em> as <em>Ovid</em> elegantly feignes according to the naturall property of the <em>Hand</em> on such occasions. ¶ Nothing more ordinary then shaking of <em>Hands</em> in <em>valediction</em> and <em>taking leave</em> of our friends, and <em>bidding them farewell,</em> of which Poets and Historians are not silent. <em>Ovid</em> brings in <em>Cadmus</em> at his transformation, speaking to his wife <em>Hermione</em> to <note place="margin">Ovid Metam. 4.</note> use this loving gesture of <em>valediction,</em> and to shake <em>Hands</em> with him while he yet had a <em>Hand</em> to shake.

Thus <em>Minutius</em> and <em>Fabius Maximus</em> Dictator gave their <note place="margin">Liv. 22.</note>
         <em>Hands</em> one to another at the time of their <em>reconciliation.</em> And when <em>Onatius Aurelius,</em> a Knight of Rome had told the people what a vision he had seen in his dream, that <em>Jupiter</em> had appeared to him that night, and willed him to tell them openly, that they should not put <em>Pompey</em> and <em>Crassus</em> out of their office, before they were <em>reconciled</em> together; he had no sooner spoken the words, but the people commanded them to bee <em>friends.

        <p>THE IMPOSITION OF THE HAND, is a naturall  gesture significantly used in <em>condemnation, absolution, pardon and forgivenesse, benediction, adoption, initiation, confirmation, consecration, ordination, sanation,</em> and <em>in gracing our meales.</em> That this gesture is of importance in <em>condemnation</em> is apparent by the commands of the old Law in case of temptation to Ethnicisme <note place="margin">Deut. 13. 9. 17. 7.</note> and practicall Idolatry.

         <note place="margin">Levit. 24. 14.</note> commanded him to be brought forth without the campe, and all that heard him were to LAY HIS HAND ON HIS HEAD. And the laying of the <em>Hand</em> on the sacrifices head that was <em>condemned</em>
         <note place="margin">Levit. 1. 4. 8. 22. 2 Chron. 29. 23.</note> in the offerers stead, so often commanded in the Leviticall Law, points to the signification of this gesture. ¶ In <em>absolution, pardon</em> and <em>forgivenesse,</em> notwithstanding the identity of gesture,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:110295:84"/>
there is a proper contrariety of expression, and this seems to be a naturall and paraphrasticall gesture, very sutable to that petition in the Lords prayer, <em>Forgive</em> us our trespasses, AS we <em>forgive</em> them their trespasses against us. For, AS Nature teacheth us to raise our <em>Hands</em> to beg pardon and forgivenesse at the <em>Hand</em> of God; so she likewise moves us to the same expression of gesture, as most proper and significant to <em>seale our pardons</em> to others; implying, that who <em>forgives</em> shall be forgiven; and neither Nature nor Grace doth move us to aske pardon on any other terms. The phrase of this gesture is significantly tooke into the formes of the Civill Law; and hath been practised in Ecclesiasticall <em>absolution.

The manner of performance at this day (it seems) is, to lay on both the extended <em>Hands</em> upon the head, so that they touch the crowne, and rest and settle downe thereon. ¶ As this gesture is significant in <em>benediction,</em> it was used by <em>Isaac</em> upon his death-bed when he <em>blessed</em> his sonne <em>Jacob</em> who supplanted <em>Esau</em> of his blessing <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 4</note>

         <em>blessing.</em> Our Blessed Saviour who with the sacred gestures of his <em>Hand,</em> hath sanctified the expressions of ours, and made them a holy language, was often seen to use this expression of the <em>Hand:</em> whence the Church commenting upon his action, saith, He by his outward gesture <note place="margin">Matth. 10. 13.</note> and deed declared his good will to little children, in that He embraced them in His Armes. LAID HIS HANDS UPON THEM and blessed them. And the very last expression that flowed from His sacred <em>Hand</em> was blessing: for at the time of His ascention He LIFTED UP HIS HANDS and blessed His Apostles, and while <note place="margin">Luke 24. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
           <desc>•</desc>
          </gap>0.</note> they beheld Him in this posture blessing them, He departed bodily from them ascending up into Heaven. Hence in all tacit posies of His ascention, this figure of the sacred property of His <em>Hand</em> is most emphatically significant. ¶ That in conferring the blessings of primogeniture and <em>adoption,</em> this gesture of the Right <em>Hand</em> is more peculiarly significant, is excellently illustrated by the adoption of <em>Ephraim</em> unto the birthright of <em>Manasseth</em> by <em>Jacob</em> when he blessed <em>Joseph</em> sons: <note place="margin">Gen. 48. 8.</note> For, <em>Joseph</em> bringing his sonnes to be blessed of his father, tooke <em>Ephraim</em> in his <em>Right Hand</em> towards <em>Israels</em> left hand; and <em>Manasses</em> in his left hand, towards <em>Israels Right Hand,</em> so he brought them unto him: But <em>Israel</em> STRETCHED OUT HIS RIGHT HAND, and laid it on <em>Ephraims</em> head which was the younger, and his left hand upon <em>Manasses</em> head (directing his <em>Hands</em> on purpose) for <em>Manasses</em> was the elder. But when <em>Joseph</em> saw
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:110295:85"/>
that his father laid his <em>Right Hand</em> on the head of <em>Ephraim,</em> it displeased him, and he staid his fathers <em>Hand</em> to remove it from <em>Ephraims</em> head to <em>Manasses</em> head. And <em>Joseph</em> said unto his father, not so my father, for this is the eldest, put thy <em>Right Hand</em> upon his head: But his father refused and said, I know well my sonne, I know well; he shall be also a people, and shall be great likewise: But his younger brother shall be greater then he, and his seed shall be full of Nations: So he blessed them that day, and said, In thee <em>Israel</em> shall blesse and say, God make thee as <em>Ephraim</em> and <em>Manasseth:</em> And he set <em>Ephraim</em> before <em>Manasseth.</em> For the Historicall <note place="margin">Tiraquel. de jure primog. Dr. F. of the Ch. l. 5. cap. 2. Pererius in Gen.</note> sense of this expression, see <em>Tiraquel</em> and Dr. <em>Field. Pererius, Rupertus,</em> and <em>Isidorus</em> affirme, that in a mysticall sense this cancelling or crossing of the Patriarchs <em>Hands</em> in exhibiting his blessing and transferring the right of primogeniture to the younger, was representatively done to prefigure a mystery of the calling of the Gentiles, and the preferring of them before the Jewes: and that this was the first type or prefiguration of the manner of the promised Messiahs passion in the decreed way of redemption. ¶ The same gesture we use in <em>gracing our meals,</em> an expression very proper and significant: For, the <em>Hands</em> reverently erected, without any other forme of speech annexed, seem naturally to pronounce this Grace.</p>
        <q>O Thou supreame Power, the giver of all good things, who openest with thy <em>Hand,</em> and fillest every living thing with thy blessings, vouchsafe, O Lord, <em>benedicendo, benedicere,</em> to let thy
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:110295:85"/>
         <em>Right Hand</em> blesse, sanctifie, and confirme unto us the blessings of thy left.</q>
        <p>And it is a brand of prophane unmannerlines in the rough <em>Hand</em> of <em>Esau</em> that he was readier to strike <em>Hand</em> with a chapman to sell Gods blessing for his meat, then with his <em>Hand</em> to invite it to his meate. Whereas our Blessed Saviour thought blessing (bid by this reverend invitation of the <em>Hand)</em> a considerable guest at a feast, who to shew that man liveth not by bread only, upon all such occasions used the signification of this gesture. Thus He blessed the five loaves and <note place="margin">Mark. 6. 41.</note> two fishes wherewith he wrought his feeding miracle. And from this Chireulogia or act of blessing and giving thanks the Sacrament used at His last supper, is called the Eucharist. And in the tearmes and stile of School-men or naturall Divines to speake to the fundamentall point of this gesture now in <em>Hand.</em> The <em>Hands</em> and <em>Blessing</em> seem to be conjugates in the Schoole both of Nature and Grace. Benediction being a naturall rite neare allied unto the <em>Hand,</em> and of spirituall affinity with prayer. For, Religion and Grace disa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

         </gap> not the powers of naturall expressions, but advance them to a full and purer perfection, improving the corporeall sense of those manifestations to a more spirituall and sanctified signification. That inexhaustible fountaine (therefore) of Blessing, our Blessed Saviour having ordained himselfe a <em>Hand,</em> and having taken upon Him the corporeall nature of man was constantly pleased to honour the nature He had so taken, and to enforce by the precept and authority of His owne example, the significant
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:110295:86"/>
convenience, religious use and decent importance of this property of blessing annexed to the <em>Hand.</em> ¶ In <em>consecration</em> this gesture hath the like congruity of signification; for there was never any thing by the expresse command of any legislator to be hallowed by a dedication, but the <em>Hand</em> was called to, and injoyned to attend as a proper addition to confirm and sanctifie all other rites; not that there is any inherent holinesse in the <em>Hand,</em> or solemne forme of expression, but an adherent only. The very heathens have acknowledged a significant vertue in this expression of the <em>Hand;</em> for we read that <em>Numa</em> was <note place="margin">Plutarch in the life of Numa.</note>
         <em>consecrated</em> upon mount Tarpeian by the chiefe of the southsayers, called <em>Augures, laying his Right Hand upon his head;</em> a piece of superstitious apishnesse they learned from the grand spirituall Impostor. <em>Moses</em> a man skilfull in all the learning of the Aegyptians, among which some secrets of our Chirosophie were judiciously veyled; by inspiration commanded the <em>Right Hand</em> of the high Priest, to wit, the thumbe thereof, or vice-hand to be hallowed with the oyle in his left palme, from thence called the Holy Finger, <note place="margin">Godwyn Jewish Antiq.</note> (a forme also observed in the Inauguration of Kings.) And the finger was used in all dippings and sprinklings of the Leviticall Law. The ground and foundation of this typicall expression <note place="margin">Levit. 4. 6. 17. 25. 30. 34. 16. 14. 9. 9.</note> seems to be laid in nature; for, the <em>Hand</em> is conceived to be as it were a shadow or image of the Trinity; for the arme that proceeds from the body, doth represent the second Person who proceeds from the Eternall Father, who is as it were the body and spring of the Trinity, and the fingers which flow both from the body and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:110295:86"/>
the arme, doe represent the Holy Ghost, who proceeds both from the Father and the Sonne. Hence <em>Hierom</em> upon the passage of <em>Isaiah,</em> To whom is the Arme of the Lord revealed, saies that the Arme of the Lord is mystically the Son <note place="margin">Hier. in Isaiah. 53. 1.</note> proceeding from the Father: To which some refer that of the Psalmist, He made strong his Arme. And the arme shadowes out the second Person in the Trinity in these respects; in coessentiality <note place="margin">Stump. Alleg. post part. vernal.</note> with the body coevallity, Ability, Utility, Agility and Flexibility. The fingers give an umbrage of the Holy Spirit in regard of their procession proceeding from the Arm and <em>Hand,</em> operation, the body working by the <em>Hand</em> and fingers, conjunction, taction, ostention, aspertion, <note place="margin">Idem part Citata</note> distinction of joynts, equall numeration, &amp;c. Hence the Finger of God in Scripture signifies the Holy Spirit, If in the Finger of God I cast out divells; but then the word Finger must be <note place="margin">Gouschel. lib. 3. eloc. sacr.

And this manuall expression is so naturally important, that it proves in <em>honorarie initiations,</em> a fitter vestment to cloath the intention in, then the airy texture of words; for it hath ever had a sacred efficacy to move the understanding

by the sense, and to facilitate the overture of sacred affaires, as being of good note and consequence conducing and inviting to the knowledge of things abstruce, there being no other part of man that can so lively and emphatically present by gesture the solemne images of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

          </gap>,</em> significant unto a thought, as that which suggests more unto the minde, then what is expressed unto the outer sense; for it hath more sollidity and weight then appeares in the bare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

         </gap> relation: And all gestures of the <em>Hand</em> being known to be of their very nature signs of imitation; the mystique property &amp; close intention of this gesture is not alone to represent it self, but to conduct and insinuate something else into the thought, which being (as it must ever be) an intelligible notion, as it is a signe or token it falls short and abates of the perfection of the thing that is implied by its outward signification: wherefore a <em>Hand</em> is but improperly said to be the shadow of its counterfeit, which is wrought by a pencill in imitation of the life, although upon sight thereof we know and conclude it to have the semblance of a <em>Hand,</em> &amp; to be a draught or copy of the originall: so this gesture is but a manuall vision of the mind most conformable to expresse divine notions, which else would lose much of their lustre, and remaine invisible to the conceit of man. This forme of expression in <em>ordination</em> as it is agreeable to the canon of Nature, so it hath received confirmation by the <em>Hand</em> of God since it first appeared in the <em>Hand</em> of the Patriarchs, the first

dispensers of personall <em>benediction,</em> who used it to betoken the <em>restrained intention of their votes unto them on whom they conferred their blessings:</em> For we finde <em>Moses</em> by command <note place="margin">Numb. 27. 18.</note> PUTTING HIS HAND UPON <em>Joshua</em> the sonne of <em>Nun</em> to <em>appoint him governour,</em> who is said to be full of the Spirit, for <em>Moses</em> had LAID <note place="margin">Deut. 34. 9</note> HIS HANDS UPON him. And when <em>Moses</em> and <em>Joshua</em> had prayed, and LAID THEIR HANDS ON the seventy Elders, the Holy Spirit came upon them. In <em>choosing</em> of Deacons this gesture <note place="margin">Acts 6. 6.</note> was used by the Apostles. And in the <em>separation</em> of <em>Barnabas</em> and <em>Saul</em> to be the Apostles of the Gentiles, this gesture is againe used. And <em>Timothy</em> is put in minde by St. <em>Paul</em> of the gift <note place="margin">Act. 13. 3. 2 Tim. 1. 6 1 Tim. 4. 14.</note> he received by this IMPOSITION OF HANDS: for not only the <em>office</em> but the <em>ability</em> were together conferred upon many by this gesture, of which acquist we must not conceive the solemne gesture to be a naturall, but a morall cause, as being the true manner &amp; form of <em>impetration,</em> God assenting, and by successe crowning the prayers of religious <em>Hands;</em> and shewed that what they did was by prayer and blessing in his name, they being, indeed, Gods <em>Hands</em> by which he reacheth Counsell and Religion, which as through their <em>Hands</em> are conveyed unto men, Christ having promised to open and shut them, to stretch them out and draw them in, as the <em>Hand</em> of man is guided by the spirit that is in man. This <em>Chirothesia vel Chirotonia</em> (for both occur in the new Testament) is used as an Ecclesiasticall gesture at this day in token of <em>elevation</em> or <em>ordination, election,</em> and <em>separation.</em> And <gap reason="foreign">

He gave sight to the blinde, yet not without touching the eye: Hearing to the deafe, not without thrusting his Finger into the eare; and speech to the dumbe, yet not without wetting the tongue, most with this gesture of IMPOSITION. Thus by TOUCHING <em>Simons</em>
         <note place="margin">Ma. 8. 15</note>
         <pb n="147" facs="tcp:110295:88"/>
wifes mothers <em>Hand</em> He cured her of her feaver. Thus by PUTTING FORTH HIS HAND, AND TOUCHING the leper, He healed him of his leprosie. Thus by LAYING HANDS on the woman <note place="margin">Mark 1. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And it is said of Him that he could doe no great workes in his owne Countrey by reason of their unbeleefe, save that HE LAID HIS HANDS UPON a few sicke folkes, and <em>healed</em> them. And (indeed) their sutes that <note place="margin">Mark 6. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

          </gap>
         </note> came unto him for helpe, were commonly tendered and expressed in such formes of speech as shewed that he much used this significant expression of gesture. For, although as <em>Fonseca</em> truly <note place="margin">Fonseca.</note> observes, the flesh of our Saviour, for that it was the flesh of God, gave life and health to all that touched it, for a certain vertue went out from all parts of Him, and cured all men, (as the woman that had the issue of bloud experimentally found) yet He was pleased (so to honor the <em>Hand)</em> to use his <em>Hand</em> in the conveyance and application of that curative vertue, as that which in nature is the most important &amp; significant member of the body: he could have said the word only and it had been done, but he would speak reliefe with his <em>Hand.</em> Thus <em>Jairus</em> besought him to come and LAY <note place="margin">Luke 8. 41</note> THE HANDS UPON his sicke daughter that she might be healed and live: And they who brought the deafe and stammering man unto Him, besought <note place="margin">Marke 7. 30. ver. 33 Luke 8. 54. See Hook, in Eccles. polit.</note> Him to PUT HIS HAND UPON him, whose requests were graciously answered in this desired and his accustomed formeof expression with his <em>healing Hand.</em> And Expositors agree that they required no expression of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:110295:89"/>
         <em>pity</em> from our Saviours <em>Hands</em> then what they had observed him to use, thereby attributing unto him the honour and right of the chiefe Prophet: For it was an expression used by the ancient Prophets as a holy charme against bodily infirmities: And of the practice of this gesture attended with a visible successe, the Heathens were not ignorant, apparent by the speech of <em>Naaman</em> who was halfe wroth with <em>Elisha</em> for <note place="margin">1 Kings 5. 21.</note> omitting this expression or pledge of health, for the thought with himselfe that the Prophet would have come out and stood, and called upon the name of the Lord his God, and PUT HIS HAND UPON the place and heale the leprosie. After the ascention of our Saviour, his promise <note place="margin">Mark 16. 17.</note> was fulfilled, that they should LAY THEIR HANDS ON the sicke, and they should be cured. Thus <em>Paul</em> received his sight by the LAYING <note place="margin">Act. 9. 17.</note> ON OF <em>Ananias Hands.</em> And thus <em>Paul healed</em> the father of <em>Publius</em> Governour of the Islle of <note place="margin">Acts 28.</note> Melita, now Malta. Thus <em>Peter</em> TAKING the Cripple that sat at the gate of the Temple called Beautifull BY THE RIGHT HAND, <em>recovered</em>
         <note place="margin">Act. 3. 7.</note> him of his lamenesse. But of all the <em>curetorie</em> miracles wrought by the vertue of this expression of the Apostles, the casting out of Divells, and freeing the possessed, most astonished the people, especially after those sons of one <em>Sceva</em> (a Jewish exorcist) had took in <em>Hand</em> to counterfeit that <note place="margin">Acts 19. 13.</note> powerfull gift by an unwarrantable imitation, and were soundly beaten for their apish and vain attempt: After the Apostles times, the exorcists (an order in the Primitive Church) used this <em>curatorie</em>

       <head>A COROLLARIE OF THE Discoursing gesture of the <em>Fingers.</em> WITH AN Historicall Manifesto, exemplifying their naturall significations.</head>

        <head>Inventione laboro. Gestus I.</head>
        <p>
         <seg rend="decorInit">THE FINGER IN THE MOUTH  GNAWN AND SUCKT, is a gesture of <em>serious and déep meditation, repentance, envy, anger,</em> and <em>threatned revenge.</em> The signification of <em>inventive meditation,</em> Poets the most accurate observers of Nature, have elegantly acknowledged. Thus <em>Propertius</em> in the emendation of a verse:
<q>
          <l>Et saepe <note n="*" place="margin">Propert. l. 2. eleg.</note> immeritos corrumpas dentibus ungues.</l>
         </q>
Thus <em>Persius</em> of an ill verse:
<q>
          <l>Nec Pluteum caedit nec <note n="*" place="margin">Pers. Sat. 5.</note> demorsos sapit ungues.</l>
         </q>
And <em>Horace</em> of the sweating and sollicitous Poet.
<q>
          <l>Saepe caput scaberet, <note n="*" place="margin">Satyr. 10.</note> vivos &amp; roderet ungues:</l>
         </q>
who in another place describing the earnest posture of <em>Canidia,</em> brings her in gnawing her long <note place="margin">Idem Epod. 5.</note> nailes:
<q>
          <pb n="159" facs="tcp:110295:94"/>
          <l>Hic inresectum saeva dente livido</l>
          <l>Canidia rodens pollicem.</l>
         </q>
         <em>Inresectum aiunt, valde sectum, aut non resectum, id enim venificae magis convenit, longos curvos<expan>

<q>
          <l>De  tener<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
           </gap> [meditetur] ungui.</l>
         </q>
And therefore in the Areopagetique School and  Councel-house, they painted among others, <em>Cleanthes</em> for the signification of his <em>earnest study</em> in Arithmeticke and Geometrie, with HIS FINGERS GNAWN about, as <em>Sydonius Apollinaris</em> reports.<note place="margin">Syndon. Apol. l. 9. epist. 9.</note>
         <em>Goropius</em> very witily fetcheth the reason of this gesture from the Etimologie of the word <em>Finger</em> thus: <em>Digiti manus significant inveniendi desiderium, nam in prima lingua dicuntur</em> Vinger, <em>qua vox denotat [invenire desidero] nam omis inveniendi facultas numeratione absolvitur, &amp; ad numerandi artem digiti maxime sunt comparati, numeros enim omnes digitis indicamus; quo fit ut merito nomen habent ab inveniendi desiderio.</em>
         <note place="margin">Goropius in Hierog.</note>  ¶ To the signification of <em>repentance, Propertius</em> alludes:<note place="margin">Propert. l. 3. eleg.</note>
         <q>
          <l>Ungue meam morso saepe querere fidem.</l>
         </q>
To the intention of <em>envy,</em> that of <em>Martial</em> is referred:
<q>
          <l>Ecce iterum <note n="*" place="margin">Martial. l. 4. epig. 27</note> nigros corrodit [lividus] ungues.</l>
         </q>
         <em>Id est pro [invidia anxius] * corrodit ungues nigros:</em> As <em>Ramirez</em> upon the place. ¶ This gesture is also a wilde expression of <em>fierce anger</em> and <em>cruell revenge,</em> as <em>Aristotle</em> advertiseth us, who when he had reckoned up those actions which are <note place="margin">Arist. l. 7. Ethic. c. 6.</note> done by reason of some <em>disease</em> or <em>evill custome,</em>
         <pb n="160" facs="tcp:110295:95"/>
he puts downe this arrosion of the nailes, which the Interpreters of that place declare to be the <note place="margin">As Zui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
           <desc>•</desc>
          </gap>
          ger in Eth. Arist.</note> property of men <em>inraged</em> with <em>choler,</em> and silently <em>threatning revenge.</em> And the Italians, a revengefull Nation, doe most usually declare by this gesture their <em>gréedy coveting to be at Hand with revenge;</em> and therefore that awfull Satyrist of the <em>angry</em> Potet:
<q>
          <l>—Crudum chaerestratus unguem <note place="margin">Perseus Satyr. 5.</note>
          </l>
          <l>Abrodens ait haec—</l>
         </q>
So they report of <em>Orestes raging</em> and transported with the <em>furious appetite of revenge</em> to have BITTEN HIS FINGER in <em>Arcadia,</em> where a <note place="margin">Pausanias</note> monument representing that expression of <em>anger</em> was built, as <em>Pausanias</em> hath left it recorded to posterity. And the masters of the Hieroglyphiques <note place="margin">Pierius in Hieroglyp l. 37.</note> pourtray out this gesture to the same significations: And if we see one BITE HIS THUMBE at us we soone infer he meanes us no good.</p>
       </div>
       <div n="2" type="gesture">
        <head>Fleo. Gest. II.</head>
        <p>TO PUT FINGER IN THE EYE, is their expression who <em>crie,</em> and would by that endeavour  of nature <em>ease themselves</em> and <em>give vent to their conceived heavinesse.</em> The reason of PUTTING FINGER IN THE EYE IN WEEPING, is, because teares falling from the EYE, with their saltnesse procureth a kinde of itching about the carnell of teares, which requireth aid of the <em>Finger</em> to be expressed at their first fall: afterward the parts affected with that quality, and one teare drawing on another, such expression is not so necessary. Besides this cause of rubbing the WEEPING EYE, a strange matter therein requireth wiping, which also moveth
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:110295:95"/>
the <em>Finger</em> to haste to the EYE watered with teares; but this is after a while, the other almost before any teare fall, as though they were expressed with rubbing. Thus <em>Moagetes</em> the Tyrant of Cibyra, when he was greatly affrighted at the minatory words of the Roman Consul, <em>Cn.</em>
         <note place="margin">Livie l. 38</note>
         <em>Manlius,</em> imposing the sum of five hundred talents in ready money to be laid down upon the naile, counterfeiting and pretending his needinesse, after much base huckling, and rising by little and little, one while hasting and wrankling, another while praying and intreating (and that with whining and PUTTING FINGER IN THE EYE) he was fetcht over at length, and came off to pay a good 100. talents of silver, and deliver ten medimnes of corne besides.</p>

       <div n="3" type="gesture">

        <p>TO HOLD UP THE THUMBE, is the gesture  of one <em>giving his voice or suffrage,</em> of one that <em>helpeth with his word at the time of election,</em> and of one shewing his <em>assent</em> or <em>approbation</em> as <em>Flavius Vopiscus</em> writeth.

        <p>THE FORE-FINGER PUT FORTH, THE REST CONTRACTED TO A FIST, is an  expresse of <em>command</em> and <em>direction;</em> a gesture of the <em>Hand</em> most <em>demonstrative.</em> This <em>Finger</em> being <note place="margin">Beckman de orig. lat. ling.</note> called <em>Index ab indicando, Deicticos</em> by the Greeks, <em>id est Demonstrator. Hinc [indigitare] verbum pro re satis idoneum, hoc est digito ostendere, vel digitum intendere:</em> And hence some of the Heathen gods were called <em>Dii indigiti,</em> because it was unlawfull to name them, or point them out as it <note place="margin">Festus.</note> were with this <em>Finger.</em> The force of this <em>Finger</em> in pointing out men of note and quality, Poets and Historians the accurate observers of the naturall expressions of the <em>Fingers,</em> doe every where acknowledge in their writings, alluding thereunto. Thus the sinewie Epigrammatist:

Where the Satyrist (as <em>Lubentius</em> comments upon the place) taking an argument from the adjunct, seems to have respect unto the History of <em>Demosthenes</em> which <em>Cicero</em> toucheth at, who was <note place="margin">Cicero <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The first time that <em>Themistocles</em>

The naturall validity of this <em>indigitation</em> of persons, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:110295:97"/>
pronominall vertue of this <em>Finger,</em> when accentively put forth, appeared in the malipert demonstration of <em>Diphilus</em> the Tragedian, when he acted <note place="margin">Cicero ad Attic. l. 2. Epist. 19.</note> in the Playes dedicated to the praise of <em>Apollo,</em> who when he came to that verse in his part, <em>Miseria nostra Magnus est,</em> directing his <em>Hand</em> and pointing to <em>Pompey</em> sirnamed the <em>Great,</em> he gave it a remarkable pronunciation; and being constrained by the people <em>who with their Hands loud applause encouraged</em> him) to repeat the same divers times; continuing in that <em>demonstrat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
           <desc>•</desc>
          </gap>ve</em> gesture, he drove out him that was guilty of too great and intollerable a power. But <em>Pylades</em> for such <note place="margin">Suetonius Augusto.</note> a speaking pranke of his <em>Finger,</em> came not off so well; for, <em>Octavius Augustus Caesar</em> banished him out of the City of Rome and Italy, because he had POINTED WITH HIS FINGER at a spectatour who hissed him of the Stage, and so made him to be known. The valiant <em>Boucicaut</em> instead of speech used such a POINT OF DECLARATION with his <em>Finger,</em> and as it is likely shewing some other of his <em>Fingers</em> afterwards to signifie that he was a kin to him he pointed at, as the <em>Fingers</em> of his <em>Hand</em> which are brethren. For in that furious battell that <em>Bajazet</em> the Turkish Emperour waged against the King of Hungarie, <note place="margin">Causin Soldier.</note> where there were many French-men, and the Count of <em>Nevers,</em> the Count of <em>Ewe</em> and <em>March,</em> and the valiant Marshall <em>Boucicaut,</em> who the next day being brought before <em>Bajazet</em> sitting under a pavilion spread for him in the field; <em>Bajazet</em> having heard by his Interpretour that the Count <em>Nevers, Ewe</em> and <em>March,</em> were neare kinsmen to the King of France, caused them to be reserved, commanding they should sit on the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:110295:97"/>
ground at his feet, where they were inforced to behold the lamentable but cherie of their Nobility. The valiant Marshall <em>Boucicaut</em> in his turne was produced; he who was wise, and particularly inspired by God in this extremity, made a signe with his <em>Finger</em> before <em>Bajazet,</em> who understood not his language, as if he would declare himselfe the kinsman of the Count of <em>Nevers,</em> who beheld him with an eye so pitifull, that it was of power to rent rocky hearts: <em>Bajaz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

          </gap>t</em> being perswaded by this signe that he was of the bloud Royall, caused him to be set apart to remaine a prisoner, where he after wards by his great prudence endeavoured the liberty of those noble Gentlemen and his owne. ¶ Sometimes this <em>Fingers [ibi]</em> stands for an <em>Aduerbe of place.</em> And it was the custome of the Romans in the meetings of divers waies to erect a statue of Mercurie with the <em>Fore-Finger</em> pointing out the maine road, in imitation whereof, in this Kingdome we have in such places notes of direction; such is the <em>Hand</em> of St. <em>Albans.</em> And the <em>demonstrative</em> force of this <em>Finger</em> is such, that we use to forewarne and rebuke children for pointing at the Pallaces of Princes as a kinde of petty treason. The Roman Histories afford us a notable example of the practice <note place="margin">Plutarch in the life of Camillus.</note> of this moving <em>Adverbe of place</em> in <em>Marcus Manlius Capitolinus;</em> for when he was accused for moving sedition, and his matter came to pleading, the sight of the Capitoll troubled his accusers much, for the very place it selfe where <em>Manlius</em> had repulsed the Gaules by night, and defended the Capitoll, was easily seen from the Market-place where the matter was a hearing; and he himselfe POINTING WITH HIS HAND
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:110295:98"/>
shewed the place unto the gods, and weeping tenderly, he laid before them the remembrance of the hazard of his life in fighting for their safety: This did move the Judges hearts to pity, so as they knew not what to doe, neither could they use the severity of the Law upon him, because the place of his notable good service was ever still before their eyes; wherefore <em>Camillus</em> finding the cause of delay of Justice, did make the place of judgement to be removed without the City into a place called the Wood <em>Petelian,</em> from whence he could not shew them the Capitoll, and having deprived him of this advantage, he was condemned. ¶ As it is a gesture of <em>command</em> and <em>direction,</em> imperious masters with a stately kinde of arrogancie often use it to their <em>meniall</em> servants who stand ready expecting but the signall of their <em>commands,</em> when they call them, not without a taunt, to execute the tacit pleasure of their lordly will; an expression flowing into their <em>Hand</em> from the hautinesse of spirit, and an insolent humour of <em>dominéering:</em> And the signe of <em>pride</em> is the greater when men aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

        <p>TO GIVE WITH TWO FINGERS, is a <em>parcimonious</em> expression of the <em>Hand</em> often  seen in <em>clutch-fists niggards,</em> and <em>pinch-pennies,</em> from whose gesture the Adage came, <em>Dare contracta manu, id est [parce &amp; frigide aliquid dare.]</em> Hence the Spaniards in the propriety of their Tongue, expresse <em>covetousnesse</em> by a <em>short Hand,</em> and <em>bounty</em> by a long and <em>large Hand.</em> These phrases do often occur in <em>Guzman,</em> which I take for a subtile contexture of the proverbiall riches and gravity of the Spanish Tongue. <em>Salomon</em> dislikes this gesture, where he saith, <em>Let not thy Hand be open to take, and closed when thou shouldest give.</em> And <em>Artaxerxes</em> the son of <em>Xerxes,</em> who was <note place="margin">Plutarch Apotheg.</note> sirnamed <em>Long Hand,</em> because he had one <em>Hand</em> longer then another, was wont to say, that as a Prince (who was Gods image upon earth) he had a <em>Hand</em> to <em>give,</em> to wit, a <em>right Hand</em> very <em>long;</em> the other to with-hold and take away, to wit, a left <em>Hand,</em> contracted and very short; adding that it was a more Princely and Royall property, to <em>give,</em> then to take away.</p>

        <p>TO BEGIN WITH THE FIRST FINGER OF THE LEFT HAND, AND TO TELL ON TO  THE LAST FINGER OF THE RIGHT, is the naturall and simple way of <em>numbring</em> &amp; <em>computation:</em> for, all men use to count forwards till they come to that number of their <em>Fingers,</em> and being come to that number, prompted as it were by nature to returne at this bound or But of numericall immensity, (about which all numbers are reflected and driven round,) they repeat againe the same numbers returning unto unity from
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:110295:107"/>
whence their account began, which we must not account as an accident, but a thing propagated from the fountaine of nature, since it is ever done and that by all Nations. For the <em>Fingers</em> by an ordinance of nature, and the unrepealable statute of the great Arithmetician, were appointed to serve for casting counters, as quicke and native digits, alwaies ready at <em>Hand</em> to assist us in our computations. Hence some have called man a naturall Arithmetician, and the only creature that could reckon and understand the mistique laws of numbers, because he alone hath reason, which is the spring of arithmeticall account; nay that divine Philosopher doth draw the line of mans understanding from this computing <note place="margin">Plato.</note> faculty of his soule, affirming that therefore he excells all creatures in wisdome, because he can account: and indeed not the least of the more subtill part of reason doth depend upon this Arithmeticall infused quality. Hence we account such for idiots and halfe-sould men who cannot tell to the native number of their <em>Fingers.</em> And if we count the dole of nature, and those numbers that were borne with us and cast up in our <em>Hand</em> from our mothers wombe, by Him who made all things in number, weight &amp; measure, we shall finde that there are five <em>Fingers</em> ranged upon either <em>Hand,</em> which quinary construction of the <em>Fingers,</em> as being of a mysticall perfection is much canvased by the Pythagoran Philosophers, <note place="margin">Plutarch Moral.</note> and called marriage, because it is a compound of the first numerall male and female; it is also fitly tearmed nature, because being multiplied it determins and rebounds upon it selfe, for five times five makes twenty five, and multiplied, by an old
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:110295:108"/>
number it still representeth it selfe, for if you take five unto five by doubling the Cinque you make the Decade; and there is in it a naturall vertue or faculty to divide, as appeares in the <em>Fingers</em> of each <em>Hand,</em> so that nature seems to have tooke more delight to order and compose things according to the number of five, then to fall upon any other forme that might have proved sphericall. Hence <em>Plutarch</em> observes that the Ancients were wont to use the verbe <em>pempasesthai</em>
         <note place="margin">Plutarch in moral.</note> when they would signifie to number or to reckon. And the <em>Memphian</em> Priests in their Hieroglyphiques, by a <em>Hand,</em> the <em>Fingers</em> set upright, used to figure out Arithmeticke. Great is the perfection of the totall summe of our <em>Fingers,</em> for Ten is the fount and head of all numbers, for this is compounded of 1. 2. 3. and 4. which united, summe up Ten; the most compleat of numbers, as possest of the formes of all the others, for both the eaven and odde, the square, cubique, plaine, the linear, the monade, and compound, with all the rest, are comprised in the Decade; which therefore <em>Pythagoras</em> the Samian, who was thought to be the first Author of the name Philosophie, as <em>Plutarch</em> affirmes, concludes the Denarie to be the most absolute perfection of numbers, because as the Poet saith we have,

         <em>Hadrianus Junius</em> by an elegant and neat discription, seems to allude to the intention of nature in devising the <em>Hand</em> so fit for all accounts, that it may serve for a counting table;</p>

      <head>PRAELUDIUM.</head>
      <p>
       <seg rend="decorInit">HOw prevalent Gestures accommodated to perswade, have ever been in the <em>Hand;</em> both the Ancient Worthies, as also Use and daily Experience make good, it being a thing of greater moment then the vulgar thinke, or are able to judge of: which is not onely confined to Schooles, Theaters, and the Mansions of the Muses; but doe appertaine to Churches, Courts of Common pleas, and the Councell-Table; where we daily see many admirable things done by those, who in the course of Humanitie and profitable studies, have been well instructed and inform'd in this facultie of the <em>Hand.</em> And the wisedom of the Ancients is in good part placed in this care and diligence, That they who were nourished to the hopes of great dignities, should have
<pb facs="tcp:110295:119"/>
composed and comely motions, which might signifie an ingenious Minde, and adorne their very Eloquence. Some may perchance imagine, that this <em>Manuall</em> Rhetorique is a vaine and unnecessary Art, because they see little writ by the Greekes, who were the Doctors of Eloquence; and but few things thereof by the Latines: when yet these men of excellent wits of both Nations, have with great artifice beautified all the sublime kindes of Eloquence, to heighten the Grandieure of a majestique Utterance. <em>Cresollius</em> alleadgeth many causes why this one part of most noble Science seemes (though not as neglected, yet) passed by and omitted by those great lights of Antiquitie. For, the Greekes borne in a region, which by reason of the thinnesse and puritie of the aire, was more fertile of good wits then any other productions; had naturally both motions of the Minde and Body to explaine and unfold their cogitations and recondite senses with an incredible facilitie: by reason whereof they l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
        <desc>•</desc>
       </gap>sse needed the precepts of this Art. For since they had two Palaestra's, wherein a double <em>Chironomia</em> was practised, one of Armes, another of Peace, and proper to the pacifique temper of Humanitie: a domesticall Theater, Doctors and Rhetorique Professors, and publique Declamations; having in common among them, such
<pb facs="tcp:110295:119"/>
illustrious aides of Pronunciation; no marvell that so few Rhetoricians have left any Manuscripts of the Conformation of gesture; this artifice of the <em>Hand</em> being a thing so common, and as it were naturall unto them. Which volubility of a prompt &amp; easie nature, wonderfully accommodating it selfe to all things, made the Satyrist say, that the whole Nation <note place="margin">Juvenal. Satyr. 3.</note> of the Greekes were Comoedians: for in the Scene and Theater, and in graphicall assimilating and imitating the affections, there were few of any Nation could match them, and none that could out-act them. And as they were very studious in all kinds of literature; when they apply'd their minds to eloquence, it cannot be said how they excel'd in gesture, by the force and guide of Nature; which perchance was the cause why the Stagerite said, <gap reason="foreign">

       </gap> to be <gap reason="foreign">
        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
       </gap>, That Rhetorique was <note place="margin">Arist. l. 3. Rhet.</note> naturall, and that any one, without the instructions of a Teacher, seems to be of himself &amp; by a Naturall ingenie, fit to raise motions in himselfe and others. But the Romans comeing out to speake, not from under the Canopie of <em>Minerva,</em> but the Pavilion of <em>Mars,</em> being not of so ready &amp; polished a wit, thought it convenient and necessary to have books of Institutions for the Conformation of these Rhetoricall expressions: of which, <em>Plotius</em> and <em>Nigidius,</em> two great Doctors in these Elegancies,
<pb facs="tcp:110295:120"/>
(to omit others) published their beauteous Commentaries. They that follow <em>Aristotle</em> in his mistaken opinion of <em>Action,</em> esteeming these Chironomicall Notions as things of no great matter, are much deceived: for that great Doctor of the <note n="*" place="margin">Aristot. Schoole neere Athens.</note>
       <em>Lyceum</em> (as <em>Cresollius</em> well observes) spake rather of himselfe, then of all men in generall: who being of a most excellent wit, and by Nature furnished with all ornaments, he contemned Rhetoricians, as seeing himself to have little need of those petty Rules which were carried about for the conformation of Manuall gestures. For else, he had <em>Demosthenes</em> in his eyes, a man wholly composed of this Artifice, and turn'd after a manner, upon the wheele of Rhetorique: who at first, by reason of his naturall imperfection herein, was much discouraged: by which it appeares, that an Oratour is not borne, but made: and to speake well and laudably, there is need of studie and striving, before the facultie can be attained. For as for this opinion of ignorant men, who thinke that Gestures are perfect enough by Nature, and that the climate availes nothing, it being not materiall whether the <em>Hand</em> be moved hither or thither: that every one may please himselfe, observing no rule or admonition of Rhetoricians: The daily Example of speakers refute. For we see many both in sacred
<pb facs="tcp:110295:120"/>
and prophane places, so preposterously &amp; ilfavoredly expressing their minds, that 'tis a wonder how any eye can behold them with attention. Certainly, men polished with Humanitie, cannot without loathing, behold the praevarications of such durty and slovenly Oratours, and with a just indignation distaste their inconsiderate action. If the Naturall motions were absolutely compleat, &amp; sufficiently fit to open &amp; unfold the sense of the Mind; or were accommodated to gaine good will, or opportune for the incredible force and varietie of the affections; would these goodly Orators and lovers of faire speech so bewray themselves, and wallow in the dirt? But this is enough, to prove that the actions of the <em>Hand</em> are not perfect by Nature. Therefore let those upstart and tumultuarie Oratours bragge as much as they will, of the force of Nature, and facilitie of Gestures. Reason, and the sayings of the learned Ancients doe not onely gainsay them, but prove these Cosmetique gestures of the <em>Hand</em> to be things of great moment, &amp; the very Palme and Crown of Eloquence. Had the ancient pieces of this Art (which ingenious Oratours writ of old, more for the benefit of after-times then their own) come to our <em>Hands,</em> men might have beene more ready in speaking then they are, and not so prone in these points, to offend
<pb facs="tcp:110295:121"/>
the discreeter part of their Auditory; but since those helpes are lost, I cannot see how an Oratour can be perfect and absolutely compleat, that hath not consulted with the Oracle of <em>Quintilian,</em> about this Manuall pronunciation; whose institutions contain all those ancient subtleties that escaped the injurious <em>Hand</em> of Time. Things which of old, they were wont to learne with their Grammar, as <em>Sidonius Apollinaris</em> witnesseth, which perchance, was the reason why <em>Polihymnia,</em> whom that learned Senatour affirmes to have <note place="margin">Cassiodor.</note> taught the Elegancie of Gesture, the same by the Greeks is said to have taught Grammar and Letters. And indeed <em>Decencie</em> of expression doth so depend upon this Art, that (as Grammarians observe) <em>Decencie</em> is properly spoken of <em>Gesture,</em> and motions of the <em>Hand</em> and <em>Body,</em> and it so exalts Beauty from the concrete into the abstract, that Nature and the tacit voice, and assent of all men, allow of it as a thing very materiall in commerce, and is so look'd for at the <em>Hand</em> of an Orator, that the defects of extemporarie and jejune Orations, have been covered by the Elegancies of this Artifice; and those that have come off unhandsomly with their expressions, for want of these comely and palliating graces of Elocution, were ever laughed at, and justly derided.</p>

       <em>ab utilitate,</em> for that they are not only assistant to eloquence, but doe incredibly conduce to all the offices of Reason and Humanity. For it is the choisest Friend of Art, the Artificer of Elocution, the Brother of the phansie, and Remembrancer to her that dwells backwards in the high Towre of Pallas, the Bodies will and Intellect, the Gift, the wit, and ingenuity of the outer man, and the better Genius of the Microcosme: In which <em>Minerva's</em> darlings, the Phalanx of the Muses, and the Pierian Band, are trained &amp; exercised as in a convenient <em>Palestra</em> or <em>Gymansium.</em> The Logisticall motions that appear in the <em>Hands</em> of Disputants, as they demonstrate the large command of the signifying faculty of the Body which flows not only into the vocall organs, but proceeds so far, as to the <em>Hands:</em> so they significantly argue the <em>Hand</em> to be a peculiar instrument of reasonable nature, especially ordeined to set a glosse upon the vocal expressions of the mind. The <em>Hand</em> being a part so prompt &amp; officious to afford the Tongue necessary aid, so powerfully inclined by its naturall gifts and abilities to bring reliefe to reason, so apt and fit on all essayes to deale in matters of expression, and to affect the hearers mindes, that whereas Man by a happy endowment of nature is allowed two instruments, <em>Speech</em> and a <em>Hand,</em> to bring his concealed thoughts unto light; the <em>Tongue</em> without the <em>Hand</em> can utter nothing but what will come forth

lame and impotent, whereas the <em>Hand</em> without the discourse of the Tongue, is of admirable and energeticall efficacie, and hath atchieved many notable things. All Histories abound with the exploits of the <em>Hand,</em> which hath performed and brought to passe more things by a significant silence, then the Tongue hath ever done by an audible demonstration. <em>Apollonius Tyaneus</em> by <note place="margin">Philostratus in vita Apollonii</note> his most famous example alone, shall serve to cleare this point, who when he had with an incredible religion observed the Pythagorean silence, neither had suffered any word to fall from him during the space of five whole yeares; yet when he came into Cities labouring of sedition, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110295:124"/>
the <em>Hand</em> in pronunciation, doe much enrich and endeare the expressions of the Tongue, which without them would many times appeare very meane: And if we consider the orations yet remaining among the ruines of former ages which were publickly pronounced, wee may cease to admire the advantages they have had over others, or themselves only penned; so that we may not so much wonder how they having been armed by discourse and voyce (together with the emphatical assistance of the <em>Hand)</em> have produced such prodigious effects: For, these gracefull aids of Speech and advantages are so peculiar to <em>pronunciation</em> and the <em>Hand,</em> that the Pen or Preffe knoweth not what they mean. This <note place="margin">Fabius lib 11. cap. 3. de Inst. Orat.</note> is sufficiently confirmed by what <em>Quintilian</em> reports of <em>Hortensius,</em> a long time Prince of Orators, afterwards Coevall and Competitour with <em>Cicero,</em> but alwayes accounted the second, whose writings notwithstanding were so short of that fame of his living eloquence of pronunciation, that it appeares there was somewhat in those Orations he pronounced which pleased very well, which they who came afterwards to read could not finde; the gifts of speaking and writing well, although compatible, yet not so inseparable that he who pretends to one, must necessarily bee possest of both. That Virgin Monarch, Queene <em>Elizabeth</em> of famous memory, whose Apothegmes may passe among the Oracles of Royall Reason, and Civill Prudence, having heard, or rather seen a Sermon that was preached before Her with the advantage of pronunciation, was much affected and taken therewith, and having the same Sermon afterwards presented unto
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110295:124"/>
Her, when She came to read it, and found not the insinuations of elocution and gesture, gave Her judgement of it, That it was one of the best Sermons She ever heard, and the worst she ever read.</p>
      <p>Not only prophane, but sacred Authours have taken notice of this solemne bond and Rhetoricall obligation between the <em>Hand</em> and the mouth, and have not only allowed the language of the <em>Fingers</em> by which the Ancients were wont to speake, but have likewise punctually set downe the office of these sides-men the <em>Hands,</em> and gravely noted their necessary imployment and concurrence to the more advantagious setting out of speech. Among the recorded advantages of gesture and Rhetoricall uniformity, the observation of <em>Noverinus</em> is not to be passed over <note place="margin">Noverinus in elect. sacr.</note> in silence, whose ingenious animadversion it is, that the Septuagint in their version of the Proverbs, where <em>Solomon</em> bringeth in wisdome <note place="margin">Cap. 1. v. 24.</note> speaking; and where St. <em>Hieroms</em> translation, or the vulgar Latine hath it, <em>Extendi manum meam,</em> in the Septuagint translation it is <gap reason="foreign">

       <em>&amp; extendebam sermones;</em> for that speech may have life and efficacie in it, the <em>Hands</em> must goe out, and gesture must appeare to the eye that it may give evidence to both senses: And <em>Solomon</em> where he accuseth the sloathfull man for not <note place="margin">Proverb. 19. 14.</note> bringing his <em>Hand</em> to his mouth, seems to have cast an eye upon the old Aegyptian symboll, and to have said, his <em>Hands</em> touch not his lips, his action agrees not with his voyce: For to this sense the Exposition of Saint <em>Gregory</em> may with little wresting be drawn, <em>Manum ad os porrigere, est voci suae opera concordare;</em> a good dependance &amp;

necessary relation, the <em>Hand</em> is joyned to the lips, and the lips must be so knit and held with the <em>Hands,</em> that sometimes our very words and speeches are turned into <em>Hands,</em> as the Septuagint in this place insinuate. And it is observable that the Spirit that is called the <em>Finger</em> of God, appeared under the form of fiery Tongues, a most excellent <note place="margin">Acts 2. 3.</note> connexion land it may be not without a Rhetoricall mystery of divine and powerfull elocution, the gift of speaking being granted hereby as well to the <em>Hand</em> as the <em>Tongue,</em> and a doore of utterance opened by the Spirit in both; no marvell therefore that they of <em>Listra</em> seeing the chiefe Speaker of the Apostles speaking in the power of these Tongues, as this <em>Finger</em> gave him utterance, tooke <em>Paul</em> for <em>Mercury</em> their imaginary <note place="margin">Acts 13. 12.</note> god of eloquence.

approbation from their auditors, and by this third supply of elegant deportment, invading the minde through the eye, with easie accesses put themselves into the possession of the people: And questionlesse those brave generous formes of discourse wherein Art hath beene married to abundance, and richnesse of speech mixed with sweetnesse and majesty of action, wherewith those great and strange conceptions of the Ancients have been so curiously limbed and plentifully adorned and graced, are but too slenderly taken notice of in these times, the perfections whereof can be of no meane importance, when without the helpe of this great secret, neither ornament of Art, nor grace of Nature can be but in part pleasing, nor (as one well observes) shall all the reasons the Tongue can alledge, perswade <note place="margin">Balzack.</note> a very woman, resolving to resist: For, the <em>Hands</em> are those common places and Topiques of nature, which receive most of those extraordinary motions which appeare in Orations, the high excesse, Enthusiasmes, raptures, and commanding beauty of expressions are here found: For, although gesture naturally floweth out with the voyce, yet comelinesse and beauty are the decent issues of apt motion, which appeare in a sweet delivery, anticipating the eare by the eye. And to speake seriously, this artifice of the <em>Hand</em> is no lesse necessary to excellent discourses and conceits, then discipline among Souldiers, without which courage is of no effect, and valour most commonly proveth unprofitable: They therefore, who in publicke, and before those who are versed in the Art of welspeaking fall short in Manuall performance,

suffering the glory of Eloquence to receive diseminution in their <em>Hands;</em> do no lesse then cast an aspersion upon the Art they professe, and abuse their hearers; since no speech ought to be publique if you intend to performe it negligently, and not to allow it all the ornaments whereof it is capable; for the polishing whereof wee need not go far, since the <em>Hand</em> is able to accommodate the <em>Tongue</em> in such occasions, as that which hath a greater variety of Synonymous expressions, and is able to outvie it in equivalent variations. This is sufficiently proved by the old emulation between that famous Oratour <em>Cicero</em> and <em>Roscius</em> the great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Master in the Art of Action; for it is certaine that most eminent Oratour would often contend and strive avie with <em>Roscius</em> whether he should more often expresse the same sentence in gesture; or whether he himselfe by the copiousnesse of his cloquence in a differing speech and variety of expression pronounce the same; which raised <em>Roscius</em> to that height and perfection of knowledge, that he wrote a booke, wherein he compared Eloquence with the Art or Science of Stage-players: And indeed the fame and estimation of <em>Roscius</em> grew hereupon so great, that learned Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

       </gap>o made a question whether <em>Cicero</em> could write better then <em>Roscius</em> could speake and act; or <em>Roscius</em> speake and act better then <em>Cicero</em> write. Hence a certaine moderne Authour reckoning up nine kinde of wits usuall at this day, makes up his account thus: <em>Imprimis,</em>
       <note place="margin">In Speculo Humorum.</note> a Simian or Apish wit; an Arcadian wit, an Autolican or embezled wit, a chance-medley wit, a smirke, quick and dextericall wit, and a Roscian wit, which is only in gesture, when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110295:126"/>
one can farre more wittily expresse a thing by a dumbe externall action, then by a lively internall invention, more by gestures then jests. This was in that Pantomimicall <em>Roscius,</em> who could vary a thing more by gestures then either <em>Tully</em> could by phrase, or he by his witty speeches. And as concerning such men wee may say of them as once <em>Cicero</em> said of <em>Piso,</em> They are wise only by signes. These Actors, the cunning counterfeiters of mens manners, were called <em>Pantomimi</em> from their multivarious imitation, their faculty, <em>Ars gestitulatoria</em> by the Romans, which one <em>Teletes</em> is said to have found out, or at least to have much amplified, who is reported to have been so excellent in this subtill artifice of his <em>Hands,</em> that he could expresse by them whatsoever <note place="margin">Athaeneus l. 1.</note> could be spoken by word of mouth. And we read of a certaine Philosopher, one <em>Memphis</em>

The first man that usurped the name of <em>Chironomon</em> or <em>Pantomime</em> among the Romans, was <em>Pylades</em> when he came out of Asia: an Art which about the time of <em>Nero</em> was brought to that authority and perfection, that many Writers both Greeke and Latine

as a thing most wonderfull cried it up to the skies. Hence <em>Demetrius</em> the Cynique who lived in the time of <em>Nero,</em> seeing one of these <em>Pantomimi</em> dancing the masque of <em>Mars</em> and <em>Venus:</em>

And wee read of a certaine Prince who comming out of <em>Pontus</em> about businesse to <em>Nero,</em> then resident at the head of the Roman Empire, when <note place="margin">Caelius l. 5. Antiq. lect. cap. 3.</note> he together with others had seen this <em>Chironomon</em> dancing so conspicuously, that although he could not heare nor understand what was sung (for they were all semi-Grecians for language) yet they understood all things very perfectly: This Prince when he was to returne home, and <em>Nero</em> had invited him with much courtesie and love, and liberally bad him aske what he would at his <em>Hands,</em> promising him readily to grant his desire; Give me, quoth he, Roy all Sir, this <em>Chironomer,</em> and with this gift you shall highly pleasure me: <em>Nero</em> demanding what that fellow might advantage him in his affaires at home, I have quoth he (most sacred Emperour) many barbarous neighbours differing in language, to understand whom, I need a great number of Interpreters, which are not easie to be had; therefore when I shall stand in need of an Interpretour, this man by significant motions of his <em>Hands</em> shall interpret all things unto me. And concerning these artfull gestures of the <em>Hand,</em> and loquacity of the <em>Fingers,</em> we must understand many passages of the ancient Poets, and Philosophers.

       </gap>ieroglyphiques who <note place="margin">Pier. Hier. lib. 35.</note> used to decypher a distinct and articulate voyce by a Tongue, adde a <em>Hand</em> comprehending the same, to note out eloquence, by that conceit implying, that speech stood in need of that moist organ the Tongue, but pronunciation required a <em>Hand,</em> to wit, an artificiall helpe to set it off, and make it beautifull to the eye. And the first inventer <note place="margin">Zeno Eleates. As Arist. writeth.</note> of the Art of Logique, to note the moods and brevity of argumentation, exhibited Logique by a <em>Hand</em> comprest into a Fist, and Rhetoricke by an open and dilated <em>Hand,</em> which is but <em>pugnus expansus.</em> Analogicall to this, is that symboll of the Cynique, <em>Manus non sunt proferendae complicatae</em>
       <note place="margin">Diogenes.</note>
       <em>confusis digitis,</em> which insinuates that speech should not be perplext in the delivery, but should be open plaine and free, for then speech labours of a blinde crampe, when it is too concise, confused or obscure. Hence Phisiognomers according to their rule <em>ad apparentiaem,</em> infer such men to be full of words whose manners and common use it is to hold the <em>Hand</em> spread out with the <em>Fingers.</em> ☜These <em>Hand</em> Critiques observing  the apparent manners of men, say, That he who customarily useth much action of his <em>Hand,</em> in his talke, is a faire speaker, and neat in his language. And that ancient Interpretour of dreames, in his Allegoricall inferences, makes the <em>Hand</em> to signifie <note place="margin">Artemid. de Som. interp. l. 1. cap. 44.</note> reason, understanding, speech and languages, which as it were by the conduct of letters, or rather an opportune speech, declares the tacit affections of the minde. <em>Ribera</em> observes, <note place="margin">Ribera Comment in proph. minor,</note> that the <em>Hand</em> in Scripture doth not only signifie the divine suggestions of Prophesie, but also all kinde of speech, especially wherein there
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110295:129"/>
is any thing commanded: and he addes the reason,. <em>Quia sicut manns movet, it a movet locutio praecipiens.</em> The reasons why grave Antiquity did render and understand all kinde of speech and language (as <em>Pierius</em> notes) by a <em>Hand,</em> are, for that the moving and significant extention of the <note place="margin">Pierius in Hierogl.</note>
       <em>Hand</em> is knowne to be so absolutely pertinent to speech, that we together with a speech expect the due motion of the <em>Hand</em> to explaine, direct, enforce, apply, apparrell, &amp; to beautifie the words men utter, which would prove naked, unlesse the cloathing <em>Hands</em> doe neatly move to adorne and hide their nakednesse, with their comely and ministeriall parts of speech: And words would have but a cold lodging in the eares of the auditors, if the <em>Hand</em> should not be the Harbinger of the Tongue, to provide and prepare the eye for their better entertainment; for as words paint out the image of the minde: So these suffragans of speech by a lively sense afford that shadow which is the excellencie of the vocall pourtraicture. Since as these gestures of the <em>Hand</em> alone, and by themselves doe speak and shew the mentall springs from whence they naturally arise; so invited by Art to the aid of Eloquence, they become the Accessories and faire spoken Adjuncts of speech. Hence the first Artificers of Manuall Rhetoricke, hit on the right veine of Oratorie, when conducted by a learned curiosity of wit they tooke in hand that polite device, and elegant design of reducing the usuall gestures of Nature into strict rules of Art, preparing the undigested motions of Nature, and making them more formall, and fit for the intention of Rhetoricke, whose life and force they made much to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:110295:129"/>
consist in the just demeanour of the <em>Hand,</em> whose motions appeare as emphaticall to the eye, as speech doth to the eare, two ports of sense, through which all passions finde an entrance to ceaze upon the minde. And hence such Orators have ever won the prise, and have had their <em>Hands</em> crowned with the Olympique palme of Eloquence, who have excelled in the subtill notions of this Art; who conceiving Rhetoricke to consist most in a decent motion of the body, bestowed well neare as much paines to adapt their gestures to Rhetoricall significations, as in the elegant disposing of their choice flowers; the <em>Hands</em> so surpassing in dignity all the other corporall adjutants of mans wit, that there can bee no eloquence without them. And they perceiving that action <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

       </gap> most sway with the people, who most commonly are led by sense, which is moved by some adequate object; that without the true knowledge of this secret of Art, none could be accounted in the number of good Oratours, &amp; that a mean Oratour instructed in this knacke of action, did oft excell the most eminent; they bent their whole endeavours for the attaining this quality. <em>Demosthenes</em> who deserves the sirname of <em>Chirocrates</em> for his active judgement in these Rhetoricall endeavours, he was wont to compose the action and gesture of his body by a great looking-glasse, and for further acquaintance with this faculty, he entertainned <em>Andronicus</em> the Stage-player, by whom being instructed in this Art after he had reformed the defect that was before in his Orations for want of Action, he grew very famous for Eloquence; insomuch that <em>Aeschines</em> the Oratour

This Art was generally practised by all the eminent Oratours of <em>Athens,</em> unlesse perchance in that sad and solemne Session of the Areopagites, where when they were to speak without affection, in an obscure and darke place, there was no cause why they should use the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the <em>hand</em>
      </p>
      <p>Among the Romane Oratours, <em>Cicero</em> to this intent made use of <em>Roscius</em> the Comoedian, and <em>Aesope</em> the Tragaedian, in his time the Masters of this kind of learning, who was wont to call <em>Roscius</em> for his great skill in these subtleties of the <em>Hand, Delicias suas,</em> his Darling: and upon a time, in a most eloquent Oration, he rebuked the people of <em>Rome,</em> because while <em>Roscius</em> was acting, they made a noyse. What an apt Scholler he proved, and what his opinion was of this Art, appeares by his book <em>de Oratore,</em> wherein he so highly extolls Action, the practice whereof help'd to intitle him to the principality of Eloquence. <em>Plutarch</em> relating the force of <em>Cicero's</em> eloquence, by reason of the sweet grace

For, in the end, when he came to touch the battaile of <em>Pharsalia,</em> then was <em>Caesar</em> so troubled, that his body shooke withall, and besides, certaine bookes which he had, fell out of his hands, and he was driven against his will to set <em>Ligarius</em> at libertie. Therefore the malice of <em>Antonie</em> forced teares and lamentations into the <note place="margin">Idem ibid.</note> eyes of the Romans, when they saw <em>Cicero's</em> Right Hand, the instrument of his divine Eloquence, with which he penn'd and pronounced the Phillippiques, nail'd fast unto his head, and set upon the <em>Rostrum</em> or Pulpit of Common pleas in the <em>Forum. Cn. Lentulus</em> also, for his excellencie in this Art, was more famous then for his vocall eloquence. <em>C. Lentulus, P. Lentulus, C. Gracchus, L. Apuleius Saturnius, Crassus,</em> and <em>C. Julius Caesar,</em> were men expert in this mysterie. <em>Antonius,</em> he used the Asiatique phrase in his pleadings, which carried the best grace and estimation at that time, full of ostentation and bravery of gesture. As for <em>Q. Pompeius,</em> sirnamed <em>Bithynicus, C. Macer, Manilius Sura, &amp;c.</em> they lost the estimation of good Oratours, for their deficiencie in this Art. But above all, most actively eloquent was <em>Q.

Some Lawyers and Divines I have observed to have been very prevalent by virtue of this artifice of the <em>Hand,</em> even in these times: among whom, most eminent was that much lamented Dr. <em>Donne;</em> of whom an ingenious friend thus in his Elegiack knell:</p>

       <l>Such was thy cariage, and thy gesture such,</l>

      </lg>
      <p>Such (as <em>Sconerus</em> notes) was the action of the Prophets and Ecclesiasticall Oratours in the Primitive times, plainly Heroique, as may be collected out of Sacred Writ, and some Commentators thereon, in whom the Eloquence of the Prophets is graphically described.</p>
      <p>Nature exhorts all men to Action consentaneous to the stile of their Elocution: which inbred and commodious propensitie, unlesse illustrated by Art, and confirmed by exercitation, is, as <em>Trapezuntius</em> notes, but as a field untill'd, which runs
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:110295:131"/>
wild with disorder'd productions. Art being the Imitator which perfects Nature, makes her actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s more dilucid, illustrious and sweet, by her positive accommodations. For whatsoever Nature doth institute in the individuals worthy observation, reduced into one exact idea, built upon generall precepts, by a perpetuall order, Art doth expose under one aspect of the Understanding: And Nature againe placed by Art, beholds the excellent actions of eminent men, and expresses them by a happy exercitation. Wherefore the ancient Rhetoricians, who cast their eyes upon Nature, and insisted in her steps, whose Art was principally bent to imitate the severall actions of the Mind with a decent and comely grace; admitted no gesture to the <em>hand,</em> but what they did find by an accurate collation to have some similitude with the truth of Nature. That which <em>Philostratus Junior</em> requires of a Painter, who would be eminent <note place="margin">Philost. jun. de Iconib.</note> by his <em>Hand,</em> is more necessary to an Oratour. He would have him that would seeme to manage that Art skilfully, to be a man endued with a good fancy and a sound judgement, actively apt to every thing, and industrious in the observing of mens natures, and assimilating their manners, and counterfeiting of all things which in the gesture and composition of the body, are the signes and notes of the tacite mind and affections. And indeed, then shall the hand of an eloquent man move aptly, and as to the purpose applyed to expresse what he takes in hand, when he hath converst with Nature, and insinuated himselfe into all the veines of the affections of the <em>Hand,</em> &amp; by diligent study hath attained to an exquisite experience in the properties
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:110295:132"/>
of the fingers, and what the naturall motions of the <em>Hand</em> are wont to be. Hence Philosophers, who can discern of the naturall causes of things, have a notable advantage: for he shall most elegantly &amp; judiciously manage his <em>Hand,</em> &amp; moderate the gestures thereof, who by the discipline of Philosophie shall apply and conforme himselfe neerest to the nature &amp; varietie of the affections.</p>

There are who alleadge this reason: For that the fruit of the Palme doth resemble the Hand and fingers, and are thereof by the Greekes named <em>dactili,</em> that is, <em>digiti,</em> fingers: for, the great <note place="margin">See Sandes Travaile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For whereas Nature assignes to each motion of the Minde its proper <em>gesture, countenance,</em> and <em>tone,</em> whereby it is significantly exprest; this grace of Gesture is conceived to be the most elegant and expressive virtue of the three; install'd by <em>Plato</em> among the Civill virtues, as the speech and native eloquence of the Body; for that those Elegant conceptions that inrich the pregnant Mind, incite the minde

He therefore that would purchase the repute of an accomplish'd Rhetorician, must pursue the knowledge of this Art, which consists in understanding the lawfull garbe and ordered motions of the <em>Hand,</em> the most puissant Agent of the soule, and which hath by some been called <em>Mens corporis,</em> or the Minde of the Body; the voyce of Philosophie admonishing in <em>Epictetus,</em> no lesse to be minded by a Rhetorician then a Philosopher:

The Ancients, especially the Grecians, were men ever very inventive of such subtleties, had a <em>Palestra,</em> or place of exercise for this purpose. <em>Talaeus</em> preferres these Canonicall gestures before the artifice of the Voyce, although his Commentator will allow the preheminence of this Art only among Nations <note place="margin">Claudius Minos in Talaeum.</note> of divers tongues, and not where the assembly is of one lip. <em>Keckerman</em> gives the voyce the dignity of precedence for our times: but he is no better than a precision in Rhetorique, of whose conceit let the learned judge, since he confesseth the Jesuites (known to be the greatest proficients in Rhetorique of our times) instruct their disciples after this manner.

This comfortable elevation of the <em>Hand</em> in <em>Benediction,</em> hath a force at this day in the <em>Hands</em> of our Reverend Divines: And (verily) there is no Blessing formally confer'd, or authentically administred, unlesse the <em>Hands</em> denote their suffrages by their visible attendance, and appeare in a due conformitie to the words ditected unto the eare. And I never saw any Grave or Orthodox Divine from the Pulpit, <em>dismissing</em> the People with a Blessing, without this adjunct and formall concurrence of the <em>Hands.</em>

But the most usuall garbe of the <em>Hand</em> in way of preparative to speech, was this of <em>Apuleius.</em> Which posture of the <em>Hand</em> preparing the Auditours attention, is found in many Statues of the Ancients. There is a Colossus at Rome, which in times past stood in the Baines of <em>Anthony,</em> the left hand whereof leaneth upon a club; but the two first <em>Fingers</em> of the <em>Right Hand</em> extended out with the Thumbe, such as of old time was the gesture of Oratours speaking, as <em>Grutterus</em> notes, which most authenticall copie of speech they seem to have followed, whose <note place="margin">Grutterus in Sylloge inscript.</note>
        <em>Hand</em> the golden History of the Crosse in Cheap was, for there were to be seene two statues of mitred Prelates having their <em>Hands</em> figured in this manner, as if they were speaking to the people. And in old hangings, in whose contexture, most part of the Historicall discourse is represented and insinuated by gestures of the <em>Hand:</em> And
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:110295:155"/>
in all ancient painted tables where any counterfeit of speech is exhibited, nothing so obvious and remarkable as this Rhetoricall posture of the <em>Fingers.</em> And the inventions and painted Histories of our moderne Artists in their representations of speech had in publicke, have a constant relation and respect unto this ancient forme of the <em>Fingers.</em> And over the ancient images of the Prophets, which pollished by the <em>Hands</em> of the Jesuits, come over to us from the Mart, there is usually a <em>Hand</em> extended out of Heaven, impail'd about with rayes, the <em>Fingers</em> retaining this gesture, as it were the <em>Index</em> of God speaking to his Prophets, as He was wont to doe of old, when He stirred up their hearts, and suggested His sacred Oracles unto them. For since they could not by any fitting semblance or fancied pourtraiture of inventive wit, describe God as He is in Himselfe; lest impiety should have tainted their imagination, and they should seeme to make the Prophet equall to his God, they would not by a grosse discription shadow out God speaking Face to face, because the Face presents the Person, <em>Nudam Divinam Essentiam,</em> as <em>Brixian;</em> cleerly as he is in Himselfe: but Hee <note place="margin">Ric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>hiard Brixian Symb.</note> hath never been seen in that manner by dreame or vision of His Seers, nor is it possible any mortall eye should endure the infinite lustre of so great a Majesty: therefore to evade the prophanenesse of that presumptuous errour, they only displaied a <em>Hand</em> from Heaven, to that intent of signification, as a more lawfull note, and as it were a member more remote from the face; and because the <em>Hand</em> is the <em>Index,</em> and signe of inspiration, and that Divine power and impulsive ravishment
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:110295:156"/>
wherewith the Prophets were raised up to Prophesie. For, Prophesie if it be strong, with the Hebrewes it is called the <em>Hand,</em> as <em>Ribera</em> observes;<note place="margin">Ribera Comment in Proph. minor.</note> in which sense the <em>Hand</em> of God is  taken in divers places of <note n="*" place="margin">So 2 King 3. 15. 2 Chron. 30. 12.

Ezek. 1. 3. 3 14. &amp; 22 8. 1. 33. 22 37. 1. 40. 1 &amp;c.</note> Scripture; for the Prophets used to call that Spirit the <em>Hand</em> of God which fell upon them when He did inspire their disposed soules, and heating them with the ravishing influence of a Prophetique fire, by a terrible illustration, filled them strangely full of His revealed will. <em>Cornelius a Lapide</em> affirmeth himselfe to have seen the like description of the Prophets in the ancient Bibles of the Vatican Library; and in his Comment upon the four greater Prophets,<note place="margin">Cornel. à Lapide Comment in 4 Proph major.</note> he hath prefixed to their Prophesies their severall effiges after the same manner; which, as it is probable, were copied out of the Vatican Bibles.</p>

        <em>THe middle <em>Finger</em> applied  unto the Thumbe, the other three let loose, is a fashion of the <em>Hand,</em> most of all commodious for a <em>Proem.</em>
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>This Action must be performed with a gentle motion to both sides, the <em>Hand</em> a little put forth, the Head together with the shoulders, with a shrinking modesty, regarding that part to which the <em>Hand</em> is carried. In <em>Narration</em> the same gesture, but a little more produced and certaine; in <em>Exprobration</em> and <em>arguing,</em> sharpe and instant; for in these parts of an Oration it is put forth longer, and appeares in a larger extent. Which should bee the best Rhetoricall figure of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:110295:157"/>
        <em>Hand</em> to frame it to expresse by Art what it cannot so well insinuate by Nature; neither by the use and practice of experienced and eloquent men that now are, nor by any advertisement of the Ancients can be certainly collected, since they differ much about the matter; some pronounce with the unfolded <em>Hand,</em> these holding it downwards, others contract it, and make thereof a Fist; some frame their action by the fourth Canon, some by the fifth Canon: Which <em>Quintilian</em> commends above all other formes allowed to be of any moment, to set a glosse or vernish upon discourse. So many Oratours, so many varying and different formes of speaking. But <em>Cresollius</em> whose judgement is Oracular in <note place="margin">Cresol. de gest. orat. lib. 2.</note> such matters, conceives that posture best observed by an Oratour, that when hee pronounceth with the open <em>Hand,</em> held abroad, and set at liberty, he would not hold it wholly down, nor altogether upwards, but in a certaine meane, which as it is (according to the opinion of Physitians) most naturall, as he notes it out of the two grand Patriarchs of Physicke, so it seemes <note place="margin">Hippoc. l. de fractis, &amp; Galen de motu Muscul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>orum l. 2.</note> to him most easie and agreeable to modesty, although this ought to be in common use, yet upon occasion the <em>Hand</em> may fall into the other postures.</p>

        <em>Cresollius</em> commends this composition of the <em>Fingers,</em> as most comely of all others, and consonant to ingenious dispositions, if the arme be extended out fore-right, which best agrees with a <em>manly</em> and <em>couragious</em> speech: or the <em>Arme</em> a little bent and the <em>Hand</em> lifted up before; a gesture much affected by elegant men.</p>

This numeration by the <em>Fingers,</em> doth likewise availe in an Epilogue, and <em>Anachephalasis,</em> as when we reckon up all the chiefe heads and aides of a matter in question, which have been brought in and alledged for the advancement of truth, or which have been evidently refuted or proved. Hence in the Areopagetique Schooles or Councel-house at Athens, they painted <em>Chrisippus</em> with his <em>Fingers</em> in this posture, for the signification
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:110295:163"/>

        <em>Tongue,</em> but his <em>Hand</em> also. This is most properly performed by the <em>Fingers</em> of the left hand. <em>Cresollius</em> commends this way of numeration in the <em>Hands</em> of our moderne Divines. So some of the Fathers when they did expound the mystery of the Sacred Trinity, they lifted up three <em>Fingers</em> of the <em>Right Hand.</em> But this simple way of computation hath been entertained since the ancient manner of account hath growne somewhat out of use. For, the ancient Rhetoricians who lived in that age wherein Wit and Industry were in their prime taking their hint from Nature, by an accommodation of Art reduced all numbers into gestures of the <em>Hand,</em> which did represent as it were the lively images of numbers: And this Art of <em>Manuall Rhetoricke</em> was so punctually observed by the ancient Rhetoricians, that it was accounted a great absurdity and disparagement to them that erred through a false and indecent gesture of computation, as appeareth plainly by <em>Quintilian</em> who gives in this testimony <note place="margin">Quintil. Rhet Inst. lib. 1. c. 10</note> thereof; <em>In causis Actor si digitorum incerto aut indecoro gestu à computatione dissentit, judicatur indoctus.</em> And <em>Apuleius</em> reprehends this in <em>Ruffinus</em> the Lawyer, for that by a deceitfull gesture <note place="margin">Apul. in Apolog. lib. 2.</note> of his <em>Fingers</em> he added twenty yeares: Whose words alluding to the same Arithmeticall expressions run thus: <em>Si tringinta annos per decem dixisses, possis videri pro computationis gestu errasse,</em>

And indeed, the Manuall number, 70. was the ancient posture of adoration; which was, the <em>saluting Finger</em> laid over-thwart the <em>Thumb;</em> Made more apparent by <em>Apuleius,</em> speaking of the adorers of <em>Venus, Et admoventes oribus sui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of these Numericall postures of the <em>Fingers,</em> are found in the statues of the Ancients. Witnes that image of <em>Janus,</em> with two faces, dedicated <note place="margin">Plinie, Nat. Hist. &amp; Macr. in Saturnal. lib. 1.</note> in the Capitoll, by King <em>Numa;</em> the <em>Fingers</em> of whose Hands were in such sort fashioned and formed, that they represented the number, 365. which are the dayes of the whole yeare: by which notification of the yeare, he shewed sufficiently, that he is the god and Patron of times and ages. <em>Pierius</em> endeavours to represent the Posture of his <em>Fingers,</em> by a verball description. And it was the custome, to place the ensignes of Honour on the more honourable <em>Hand,</em> and to <note place="margin">Pier. in Hierogl. lib. 37.</note> figure the left Hand of Oratours, and other great men, to note out the first, second, or third time of their accesse unto that Office or Dignitie.</p>
       <p>These postures, devised by a happy dexteritie of wit, were recorded among the Aegyptian Letters or Hieroglyphicks, as unfit to be prostituted to the Vulgar, in regard they did allude to all the Pythagoricall secrets of Numbers, insomuch as the Caveat of <em>Pythagoras</em> might have been placed over the Rhetorique-School-doore of the Ancients: <em>Nemo Arithmeticae [Manualis] ignarus hic ingrediatur.</em> And the Notions of this Art are not onely necessary to Oratours, but to all men, especially the Sonnes of Art, although by the carelesnesse and negligence of men, it is growne somewhat out of use. In the practice of this Art, some follow <em>Bede,</em> others embrace a more probable way of account. Some follow the order of <em>Irenaeus</em> the Divine, a man of great <note place="margin">Iraeneus. in Valent. lib. 1. c. 13.</note> learning and generall parts, who flourished some ages before <em>Bede.</em> But among the modern, <em>Lucas Minoritanus</em> is above comparison the best, who hath a most absolute Tract of this argument.</p>

        <seg rend="decorInit">TO use any Grammaticall gestures  of compact, or any snapping of the <em>Fingers,</em> or amorous intimations invented by Lovers of old, is very unsutable to the gravity of an Oratour. The naturall discourses of the <em>Hand</em> being so plaine to be understood, the Ancients assay'd to finde out in the <em>Hand</em> a more close &amp; private way, contriving by a close compact how men might signifie their mindes; a kinde of speaking, used by such who would not openly expresse themselves, yet in a

dumb &amp; wary kinde of signing, intimate their intention, an Art first found out and exercised by Lovers, when with great caution they would present their affections, and make their <em>Fingers</em> convey a message from their heart. Of these cautionarie notes of Lovers, <em>Ovid</em> that grand Master of love knacks, and amorous expressions, affordes us many touches:
<q>
         <l>Nil opus est digitis per quos arcana loquaris. <note place="margin">Ovid de Art. Amand.</note>
         </l>
        </q>
And in another place:
<q>
         <l>—Et in digitis litera nulla fuit.</l>
        </q>
And againe glancing at the same Grammaticall expressions, he saith;
<q>
         <l>—Nec vos <note place="margin">Lib. 2. de Art. Amand.</note>
         </l>
         <l>Excipite arcana verba notata manu.</l>

And instructing his Mrs. in the way of tacit conferences:</p>

       <p>And to this kinde of amorous discourse by speaking <note place="margin">Idem. l. 1. de Trist.</note> signes, that of his refers:

        <note place="margin">Salom. Proverb. 6. 13.</note>
        <em>literas.</em> And <em>Salomon</em> alluding to these kinde of expressions, He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his <em>Fingers.</em> Sometimes the Ancients did to this purpose of secrecie and private communication, order an Alphabet upon the joynts of their <em>Fingers,</em> which Artifice of Arthrologie obtained a privy force by shewing those letters by a distinct and Grammaticall succession. Amongst which Grammars by gestures, The postures of the <em>Fingers</em> which appertaine to the old Manuall Arithmeticke, have been contrived into an Alphabet, of which way of intimation, <em>Baptista Porta</em> hath treated at <note place="margin">Bapt. Por ta de fur. lit. notis.</note> large. To the same intent the Naturall and Rhetorical postures of this <em>Hand</em> may be reduced into mystique Alphabets, and be very significantly used for cyphers without any suspicion. Sometimes of old they used for a light watch-word a snapping collision of the <em>Fingers</em> called <em>Crepitus Digitorum,</em> which imperious way of silent expression, &amp; the phrase whereof is used for a hyperbolicall diminitive of the least signification. <em>Lyra</em>
        <note place="margin">Lyra in Prov. 6. 13</note> in his learned descant upon the Proverbs harping upon this string, The unthrifty and wicked man instructeth with his <em>Fingers,</em> saith, <em>Digito loqui, arrogantiam &amp; superbiam indicat.</em> And St. <em>Hierom</em> in a certaine Epistle, saith, <em>Superbiae est signum cum quis per digitorum crepitum vult intelligi.</em> The notification and sound of this arrogant gesture, was reckoned among the nocturnall and darke signes of Lovers. Masters

also by this snapping of their <em>Fingers</em> used to call their servants, upon the hearing of which watchword, they were to be presto and at <em>Hand</em> to execute their dumbe commands. To this custome I finde that of <em>Petronius</em> referred, <em>Trimalcio lautissimus homo digitis concrepuit, ad quod signum matellam</em>
        <note place="margin">Petron Arbiter Satyr.</note>
        <em>Spado ludenti supposuit, exonorata ille vescica, &amp;c.</em> To this also belongs that of <em>Tibullus:</em>

         </l>

To which <em>Martial</em> likewise alludes

        </q>
And in another place:
<q>
         <l>Digiti crepantis signa novit Eunuchus.</l>
        </q>
Which custome the Christian Pedagoge would have excluded from the <em>Hands</em> of men piously affected, whose minde <em>Clemens Alexandrinus</em> hath <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 7. Paedag.</note> expounded thus: <em>Digiti expressi soni, quibus accersuntur famuli, cum sint rationis exportes significationes, ratione praeditis hominibus vitandi sunt.</em> This kinde of commanding gesture is most common to the Spaniard, whose humour is only a medley of arrogance and imperious pride, whence he is <note place="margin">Palomatius in proport.</note> most commonly detested of all Nations, for his naturall odious desire of sovereignty over others. And the Romans, the ancient Lords and Masters of the World growne insolent by the greatnesse of their Empire, could well skill of this proud intimation of their <em>Fingers.</em> For, <em>Tacitus</em> tells us, that the innocencie of <em>Pallas</em> was not so gratefull <note place="margin">Tacitus Annal. lib. 13.</note> to the people of Rome, as his insupportable pride was odious. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some of his freedmen were said to have been privie to the practice of a conspiracie against <em>Nero,</em> he made answer, that in his house he appointed nothing to be done, but

with a nod of his <em>Hand</em> or head, or by writing, if he had much to say, lest if he should have spoken unto them, he should seem to have made them his fellowes. Some Oratours of old affected this percussion or knacking with the <em>Fingers,</em> both to procure audience, to maintaine their authority, and for the signification of gravity; of which custome many Authours make mention, especially St. <em>Hierom,</em> for so he hath left it written: <note place="margin">D. Hieron Epist. 101.</note>
        <em>Et audet quidam ex iis adducto supercilio &amp; [concrepantibus digitis] eructare &amp; dicere.</em> And in another <note place="margin">Idem Epist. ad Rusticum Monach.</note> place speaking of that jangling fellow <em>Grunnius,</em> he hath this, <em>Cum mensa posita librorum exposuisset struem, adducto supercilio, contractis<expan>

        <em>Digitorum sono pueros ad respondendum ciemus:</em> So that this gesture hath travelled from the businesse of common and individuall life, into Schooles, Auditories, and Common-Pleas; for, this knacke of the <em>Fingers</em> was got in use with many, so that <em>[Digitis concrepare]</em> seems to have been used by the Learned, <em>pro re facilima.</em> So in the judgement of <em>Cresollius, Tullie</em> disputing of his Offices, takes <note place="margin">Cicero l. 3 de officiis.</note> it, <em>Ita<expan>

        <note place="margin">Cujacius observat lib. 3. c. 18.</note> (as <em>Cresollius</em> rightly collects) is altogether the same with <em>[crepitus digitorum]</em> or <em>digiti concrepantes,</em>

common assemblies of people, and in publique Theaters; which was at first, according to the simplicitie of those times, plaine and naturall: for <em>Ovid</em> speaking of the primitive and ancient Playes of the <em>Romans,</em> saith: <note place="margin">Naso l. 1. de Arte Amandi.</note>
        <q>
         <l>—Plausus tunc arte carebat.</l>
        </q>
But afterwards they had an artificiall manner of clapping their <em>Hands,</em> to a certaine measure or proportionable tune. Of which, the Poet <em>Carippus:</em>
        <q>
         <l>Ingeminant<expan>

          </expan> cavos dulci modulamine plausus.</l>
        </q>
For, the applause was done with the hollow of both <em>Hands;</em> which being smitten together, caused that sound which is called <em>Popismus,</em> a word altogether feigned to the similitude of the sound. The posture of this artificiall plaudite of the <em>Hands,</em> and the sound also raised from their collision, <em>Philostratus</em> most elegantly describes in the <note place="margin">Philostratus, l. 1. de Iconibus.</note> image of <em>Comus</em> the god of Ebrietie, in these words: <em>Plausum etiam quendam imitatur pictura, cujus maximè indiget Comus. Nam Dextra, contractis digitis, subjectam sinistram ad cavum plectit, ut Manus cymbalorum more percussae consonae siant.</em> The very figure of which gesture is to bee seen in the French translation of that Author. How ambitious was <em>Nero</em> of this popular approbation, when he entred upon the Theater to contend for the prize of Harpers; and kneeling, shew'd a reverence to the Assembly with his <note place="margin">Tacit.

        <em>Hand:</em> and the Citie-people accustomed also to approve the gesture of the Player, answered him with a certaine measure and artificiall applause. Thou wouldst have thought, saith <em>Tacitus,</em> they had rejoyced, and perhaps for the injurie of the publique discredit. But those which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:110295:174"/>
from townes farre off, and from remote provinces, unacquainted with dissolute behaviour, came either as Embassadours, or for private busines, could neither endure that sight, nor applaud any way so dishonorable a labour: but weary of their unskilfull clapping of <em>Hands,</em> and troubling the <em>skilfull,</em> were often beaten by the Souldiers, placed in thick array, lest any moment of time should be lost by an untuned and disproportionable crie, or slothfull silence. The like applause he expected and had from the <em>Hands</em> of his friends at home; for <em>Xiphilinus</em> reports, that <em>Seneca,</em> and <em>Burrhus,</em> though lame of his Hand, when ever <em>Nero</em> spake, they applauded him with their <note place="margin">Xiphil. in Nerone.</note>
        <em>Hands</em> and Vestments. The ancient Sophisters were so greedy of this manner of applause in their Schooles and Auditories, that they purchased <note place="margin">Cresol. Theat. vet.

This Applause, which <em>Nazianzen</em>

But although the ancient Oratours received this token of <em>approbation</em> from the <em>hands</em> of their auditors, yet they never exhibited upon any occasion, such Manuall plausibilitie to the people, it being a Gesture too plebeian &amp; Theatrically light for the <em>Hands</em> of any prudent

For <em>Galen,</em> when he would expresse the <em>Hand</em> to be conveniently dispos'd for the conteining of water that it flow not out, calls this purpose of the <em>Hand, Manum supinam.</em> But this would be done more unseasonably, and to lesse purpose, if a man by the motions of his Hands should use to imitate one taking up water out of some river, as he in <em>Virgil;</em>
        <q>

Indeed, tender and delicate minkes, after their right womanish garbe, lay their <em>Hands</em> upright, which a wise man should not imitate: and therefore in his opinion, that excellent Poet <em>Aeschylus,</em> with exquisite <note place="margin">Aeschylus in Prometh.

       <p>THey who cast and throw out the <em>Hand,</em> or raise the Arme with a shout, if they doe it as of a customary disposition, declare thereby the jovialitie of their natures.

       <p>THe wagging and impertinent extension of  the <em>Fingers</em> in speaking, hath ever been accounted a note of levitie and folly. And such who by a certaine reciprocall motion doe ever and anon lift up one or other of their <em>Fingers</em> visibly prolonged, they seeme to trie conclusions with their hearers, and to play with them at that exercise which was in use among the ancient Romans, who had a game or lotterie wherein one held up his <em>Finger</em> or <em>Fingers,</em> and the other turning away, ghessed how many he held up: Or if you will have it according to <em>Polidors</em> relation, the play was after this manner: <note place="margin">Polidor. lib. 2. c. 13. de rerum invent.</note> Two, having first shut their <em>Hands,</em> forthwith let out their <em>Fingers,</em> naming a certaine number. As for example, I put forth three fingers, you as many; I name foure, you sixe: so you by ghessing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:110295:176"/>
and naming the right number, winne. And because the <em>Fingers</em> thus unfolded, suddenly appeare, by a metaphor they were said in this sport <em>Micare digitis.</em> Hence <em>Varro; Micandum erat cum Graeco, utrum ego illius numerum, aut ille meum sequatur.</em> This is well knowne among the Italians at this day, and vulgarly called <em>Mor;</em> perhaps (saith <em>Polydor) quòd Maurorum hic sit ludus.</em> But the more approved opinion is, <em>quòd</em>
        <gap reason="foreign">

        </gap>, <em>id est, Stultorum ludus.</em> And perhaps <em>Nero</em> had observ'd in <em>Claudius</em> his predecessor, some such <note place="margin">Suetonius &amp; his Interpreter.</note> kinde of indiscreet prevarication with his <em>Fingers,</em> who in spightfull and contumelious manner both in word and deed, was wont every way to taunt and twit him with his folly; and among other opprobrious indignities offered to his name and memory, in scoffing wise he would say of him, that he had left now <em>Morari</em> any longer among men; using the first syllable of the word, long: in which word there is couched a double sense, which gives the grace unto this pleasant scoffe; for being a meere Latine word, it signifieth to stay or make long abode: and taking it thus, it importeth, that <em>Claudius</em> lived no longer among Mortalls. But as <em>Nero</em> spake of <em>Moros</em> in Greeke, which signifies a foole, and hath the first syllable long, it importeth, that <em>Claudius</em> play'd the foole no longer here in the world among men. <em>Cresollius</em> condemnes this <em>Finger-loping</em> gesture as very uncomely, and unworthy <note place="margin">Cresol. de de gestu Orat. l. 2.</note> the discreet <em>Hand</em> of an Orator, so unadvisedly to counterfeit the common gestures of Buyers of confiscate goods: and he would have the Edict of <em>Appronianus,</em> Provost of the Cittie of <em>Rome,</em> to be set before them; in which he did desire this up-and-down motion of the <em>Fingers</em> to be cast not onely out of the Courts of Justice and the Senate house, but from the Forum, and very entercourse of buying and selling. This Edict is yet to be seen in a marble table at <em>Rome,</em> beginning thus.

leave the Earth: is a Praevarication in Rhetorique. Such Oratours have been compared to Ostriches, who goe upon the ground, yet so, that by the agitation of their wings, they seeme to thinke of flight. This happens to some by reason of a certain Plethorique wit and ardor of Nature, which scarce suffers it selfe to be kept down and holden by the body. <em>Cresollius</em> once saw such a Divine, whose habituall mobilitie of his <em>Hands</em> was such, that the strongest men could scarce emulate, unlesse by an incredible contention of labour. Some, through a puerile institution, or by a contracted custome doe the same; imitating little birds, which being not yet fledged, nor strong enough for flight, yet in their nests move and shake their wings very swiftly. These the Greekes call <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
        </gap>, which they use to object against those who by a foolish gesticulation appeare in the posture of little birds. The Polite Comoedian elegantly, <gap reason="foreign">

        </gap>, <em>nugaris gesticulando.</em> This doth usually <note place="margin">Aristoph.</note> appeare in many, in the gesturing and skipping motions of joy, when the exultant Minde leaps and lifts up it selfe; and tickling the body with an active sweetnes, shakes those parts most which are more free and prompt to action. <em>Diphilus</em> a Greek Poet, pleasantly expresses this in his <em>Parasite;</em> whom he brings in, rejoycing, with <note place="margin">Athen. l. 9</note> this exultant motion of his armes. <em>Atticus Lysias,</em> in an Oration of his, hath elegantly signified the same; who, when he would prove the Adversarie not onely to be conscious of the injurie, but to be the principall author of it; he brings this perspicuous signe, that he imitated the crowing gesture of a Cock of the game, after

       <p>TO use no Action at all in speaking, or a heavy  and slow motion of the <em>Hand,</em> is the propertie of one stupid and sluggish. <em>Hyperides,</em> whom <em>Plutarch</em> reckons in the Decad of Oratours, was of this temper; for it is said, that in his Orations he shewed no action or gesture at all: his manner was, to set down the Cafe, and lay open the matter plainly and simply, without troubling the Judges any otherwise then with a naked narration. Which <em>Aeschines,</em> as some thinke, did strive to imitate; who in a foolish emulation of <em>Solon,</em> and by praising his <em>Hand,</em> strove to countenance his opinion of an unactive pronunciation.

        <em>Aristides</em> was wont to say, that such dull Oratours <note place="margin">Aristides to. 3.</note> were very unlike <em>Orpheus;</em> for he, as the fables report, enticed and drew stones after him: but they, as wood and stones, move no man. <em>Cresollius</em> (who hath prepared much of this intelligence <note place="margin">Cresol. in Vacat. Autumn.</note> to my hand) sticks not to joyne together such men who speake without action, to those statues made by the Ancients in the ignorant ages of the world: for they had their eyes shut, their hands hanging down and joyned to their sides. <em>Daedalus,</em> a cunning and witty man, was the first that formed the eyes, and put forth the Hands, so giving life and motion to all the parts, with singular judgement, teaching thereby the decencie thereof; wherefore he is feigned to have made those statues and pourtraictures of men so excellently, that they moved of themselves.

       <p>TOme a sure out &amp; distinguish the intervals of  an oration by scanning motions of the <em>hand,</em> &amp; certain delicate flexions, and light sounding percussions of the <em>Fingers,</em> is an action condemned in the <em>Hand</em> of an Oratour, called by <em>Quintilian</em> in his Prohibition against this action, <em>Ad numerum articulis cadens;</em> and explaining himselfe in this matter, he saith, <em>Soluta oratio non descendit, ad strepitum digitorum.</em> Indeed <em>Protagoras</em> cal'd Man <note place="margin">Fabius l. 9. cap. 4.</note>

the measure of all things. The Learned very fitly call Measure the daughter of the <em>Fingers,</em> and the Aegyptians used to signifie measure by a <em>Finger</em> painted. Hence the meeting and scanning of verses upon the <em>Fingers,</em> hath been a very ancient custome, and it was the manner of old in the recitation of the verses of Poets, in the measuring and singing them, to note out the intervalls and stroaks by a certain motion of the <em>Hands,</em> wherein the <em>Fingers</em> exhibited a sound, which <em>Quintilian</em> cals <em>[Digitorum ictum]</em> for he saies in meeter, <note place="margin">Fabius l. 9. cap. 4.</note>
        <em>[Digitorum ictu] intervalla signari.</em> S. <em>Augustin</em> not obscurely consents to the same, who attributes singing, applause and percussion, to the recitation of verses: hence that sentence of <em>Seneca's</em> to be taken notice of, <em>Quorum Digiti aliquod inter se carmen metientes semper sonant,</em> where <note place="margin">S.

The Hebrewes call the <em>Right Hand Jamin,</em> the South, the light and active <em>Hand;</em> and the left the North, the obscure and darke hand, much inferiour to the South. <em>Homer,</em> though hee differ, yet maintaines the dignity of the <em>Right Hand</em> above the left, in calling it the <em>Orient,</em> and the left the <em>Occident.</em> The <em>Hand</em> is so occupied in endeavouring and doing, that the Greeks, who to the advancement of wisdome have flourished in polishing humanity, and inventing names, call it <gap reason="foreign">

        <em>sinistra nunquam sola gestum facit,</em> and how should it make of it self a compleat action, since the action thereof is more contracted, infirme, incomposed, and out of order? whereas the actions of the <em>Right</em> are free, frequent, continued, composed, and resembling the sweet cadencies of numbers; &amp; therefore hath the prerogative of eloquence in the body, as being nearest the principle of motion, and most apt to move and signifie. And because the left hand of it selfe is of very small dignity in pronunciation, common humanity doth teach us, that as a Virgin shut up in her chamber, it should be modestly concealed; the <em>Right Hand</em> on the contrary, as a most goodly Scepter of Reason, with its force and weight, doth much among men.</p>

For the truth is, the Left Hand wants that agilitie, excellence, force and grace in point of action, being made contrary and unhappy by its scituation: whereupon 'tis called <em>Sinistra</em> in latine, <em>quia sine astris bonis.</em> And the lack of grace in doing of a thing, is called <em>Sinisterit as,</em> and <em>sinistrè</em> the adverb sounds unhappily. The best way (therefore) that it can be imployed, is in attendance on the <em>Right;</em> which by the course of Nature hath the prioritie, as the more proper and propense, and apter to make good its actions by a more handsome diligence, as being planted neerer the fountain of the blood. And verily, the Left Hand seemes to be born to an obsequious compliance with the Right. And therefore when <em>Quintilian</em> calls for this acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modation, he seems to have had respect unto the Interpretour of Nature, whose well-grounded Axiome it is, <em>Ita comparata esse à Natura, ut Laeva Dextris obsecundent.</em>

For the Left hand in this businesse, hath onely usurped the office in the second place, as being of a lower nature then the <em>Right;</em> neither is it of that fortune or reputation: whence, in all Naturall devices and matter of forme or token of the <em>Hand,</em> or any utterance implying the freedome of election, the introducing of the Left hand doth abate, and denotes a subordinate propertie. 'Tis the Right Hand (according to <em>Isidor)</em> that hath its name <em>à dando,</em> by which we understand a joyfull abundance <note place="margin">Isidor.</note> of all good: the extension of that Hand therefore, hath been ever of more repute in conferring <em>Benediction.</em> And <em>Justin Martyr</em> sayes, it was an institution of the prime Apostles, that the <em>Right Hand</em> should confer the badge of <note place="margin">Just.

and naturally more apt to deteine, then to bestow a Blessing. Yet notwithstanding, the Left Hand, though it contribute little, yet as in some Naturall and civill actions, it is conformable and obsequious to assist the <em>Right:</em> so in the more accomplish'd and plenary exhibition of this sacred rite, it hath oft Diaconiz'd unto the <em>Right;</em> but of it selfe alone somewhat improper, and ever subordinate unto the <em>Right.</em> Hence among other prodigies happening in the time of <em>Caesar Dictator,</em> which were thought to prognosticate but small happines.

       <p>TAke heed of a <em>Hand</em> Solecisme, or of transgressing  against the rule of Action, by the incongruity of your <em>Hand</em> and Speech: For to speake one thing with the Tongue, and to seem to meane another thing by a contrarient motion in the signifying <em>Hand,</em> and so to thwart and belie a mans selfe, hath been ever accounted a grosse absurdity in Rhetoricke, and the greatest solecisme of pronunciation. Which makes to this purpose; Wee read how at the Olympique Games which in times past were celebrated at Smyrna, where <em>Polemon,</em> that skilfull Sophister was present, there enters the Stage a ridiculous Player, who when in a Tragedy he had cried out <gap reason="foreign">

        </gap>, <em>hic manu solaecismum admisit:</em> Wherefore being President of those Games, he by his censure deprived that rude and ignorant Mimique of all hope of reward. For reconciling of the <em>Hand</em> and Tongue, and bringing them to an uniformity of signification, and for maintaining their naturall and most important relations, Rhetoricians have agreed upon many Canons and Constitutions. And the <em>Hand</em> then
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:110295:189"/>
only accords and complies with Speech, when it moves to verifie our words; for if the motions of the <em>Hand</em> doe dissent from the expressions of the Tongue, it may contradict and convince the tongue of vanity; for so we may <em>commend</em> even when we doe <em>reprove,</em> if the gainsaying Hand should have a contrarient motion; seem to <em>confirme</em> when we are in <em>doubt,</em> when we <em>forbid,</em> our <em>Hand</em> may deport it selfe into the forme of an <em>exhortation;</em> we may <em>acquit</em> when we <em>accuse, accept,</em> when we <em>refuse,</em> and <em>abhor, comply</em> in words, yet by our disordered Hand <em>bid defiance,</em> be <em>sad,</em> with a <em>rejoycing Hand, affirme</em> and <em>grant,</em> what we <em>deny,</em> and many other waies thwart and belie our selves. No true construction can be made of any speech, nor can we evade such dull absurdities of this <em>voucher</em> of our words, do move in opposition to their meaning; for without judgement and advice, which should set in order and support the thought into the <em>Hand,</em> that is ever ready to maintaine that trust that the Tongue endeavours to obtaine, <em>Truth</em> wants her warrant, and is so absurdly crost, that the efficacie of Speech is utterly defac'd, and all the credit that such language amounts unto, is the pittance of a doubtfull faith.</p>

Then the <em>sentences</em> are to be weighed, which vary with the affections, in expressing which, diligence must be used.

       <p>ALthough an Orators art should not altogether  consist in imitation, yet remember, that Imitation is one of the great Adjutants, and chief Burnishers and Smoothers of Speech: it having been an ancient and laudable custome, for ingenious Sparks of Oratorie, to be present at the Declamations of eminent Oratours, &amp; studiously to observe their Countenance and <em>Hand. Plinie</em> dislikes those, that imitate none, but are examples unto themselves. The same <em>Plinius Secundus,</em> a famous <note place="margin">Plin. lib. 6. Epist. ad Maxim.</note> Pleader, and most sweet Orator, among others that applied themselves unto him, had <em>Fuscus Silinator</em> &amp; <em>Numidius Quadratus. Junius</em> also commended to him by his ancestours, was trained <note place="margin">Idem. lib. 8. epist.</note> up in the Examplar doctrine of Manuall gestures. Hence the Tribe and Nation of Oratours were called by the name of those eminent men which they did imitate. <em>Sidonius,</em> truly sirnamed <em>Apollinaris,</em> call'd those <em>Frontoneans,</em> who did imitate <em>Fronto</em> a famous Philosopher and Oratour, the patterne of Eloquence to <em>M. Antonie.</em> So the followers of <em>Posthumus Festus</em> were called <em>Posthumians. Sulpitius,</em> not the least in the Chorus of elegant men, imitated the Hand of <em>Crassus,</em> that Nightingall of the Forum, the glory of the Senate, and (as <em>Tullie</em> sayes) almost a god in speaking: (of whom, that (it seemes) might be spoken, with small exchange of words, which was Hyperbolically said of <em>Herods</em> eloquence; <em>Non Manus hominem sonat!)</em> Wherein <note place="margin">Acts 12. 22.</note> He was so happy and industrious, that he was accounted to be very like unto him.</p>

And what did some imitate? Certaine moales and defects of Action, and so fell into an unpleasant and odious kinde of Manuall composition. Therefore <em>Nazianzen,</em> a man of a most <note place="margin">Greg.

One Action becomes one man, and another kind of behaviour, another. That which one does without Art, cannot wholly be delivered by Art; for there is a kind of hidden and ineffable reason, which to know, is the head of Art. In some, the Civill vertues themselves have no grace: in others, even the vices of Rhetorique are comely and pleasing.

       <head>Cautio XXXII.</head>
       <p>IN the Rhetoricall endeavours of the <em>Hand,</em> as in all other Actions, the golden Mediocrie is  best, and most worthy the <em>hand</em> of a prudent man. For the action of the <em>Hand</em> should be full of dignitie and magnanimous resolution, making it a liberall and free Index of the Minde; such as theirs is, who are said by <em>Xenophon</em> to be inspired with divine love, who (as he sayes) <em>gestus ad</em>
        <note place="margin">Xenoph. in Symp.</note>
        <em>speciem quandam maximè liberalem conformant.</em> Which forme of apparence consists in a certaine moderation of gesture, no chafed and incomposed rashnes, or a too daring garbe of action, nor superfinicall demeanour: nor on the other side, a rustique and homely fearfulnesse, which is wont to discourage and disappoint the purpose of necessary motion. Yet of the two extremes, it is least faulty to draw nigh to modestie, and an ingenuous feare, than to impudencie. The manner and tempering of gesture, is not onely to be fetched from the things themselves, but also from the age and condition of the Oratour: for otherwise a Philosopher, or some grave person: otherwise a young Sophister, lifted up with study, and boyling over with the fervencie of an active spirit. A soft and calme action most commonly becomes grave men, endued with authoritie: which to one in the flower of his youth, would be accounted slownes, and a slacking negligence. Modification of gesture hath also regard to the condition and qualitie of the Auditours; for an Oratour should first consider, with whom, and in whose presence he is about to act: for in the Senate, or hearing of a Prince, another action is required than in a Concion to a Congregation of the people, or an
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:110295:193"/>
assembly of light young men. Among Kings, and Potentates, and Fathers of the Court, regard is to be had to their illustrious power &amp; authority, all juvenile gestient pompe and ostentation laid aside, by a submisse Action he must transferre all dignity from himselfe. Concerning this golden point of <em>moderation,</em> there is a Nationall decorum imposed upon men by <em>time</em> and <em>place;</em> for according to the Genius of that climate, wherein we converse, <em>moderation,</em> may admit of a divers construction. In Italy a faire spoken, and overmuch gesturing with the <em>Hand,</em> is held comely and acceptable. And in France he is not a <em>la mode,</em> and a compleat <em>Mounsieur,</em> who is not nimble in the discoursing garbe of his <em>Hand,</em> which proportionable to that language is very briske, and full of quicke and lightsome expressions. And your French Protestant Divines are easily good Chirologers, some I have lately seen in the Pulpit, to my great satisfaction, and have gone away more confirmed in the validity of these Rhetoricall gestures, there being scarce any one gesture that I have cut, but I have seene used in the heat of one discourse of Polemicall Divinity, such Logicall asseverations appeared in their <em>Hands.</em> In Germany, and with us here in England, who in our Nationall complexion are neare ally'd unto the Germans, <em>moderation</em> and gravity, in gesture, is esteemed the greater virtue. The Spaniards have another Standert of moderation and gravity accorded to the lofty Genius of Spaine, where the <em>Hands</em> are as often principalls, as accessories to their proud expressions. But our language growne now so rich by the indenization of words of all Nations,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:110295:194"/>
and so altered from the old Teutonique, if the rule of <em>moderation,</em> be calculated according to the Meridionall proprietie of our refined speech, we may with decorum and gravitie enough (as I suppose) meet the <em>Hand</em> of any of these warmer Nations halfe way, with the <em>Manuall</em> adjuncts of our expressions.</p>
