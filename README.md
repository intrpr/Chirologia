# Text to HTML to printed PDF

10 Jul 2019: Found css4.pub which opens up massive possibilities for this project. Would like to try three experiments here:
- Chirologia, by John Bulwer, 1644 and convert to PDF for print
- JSB *Dictionary of Action…* and convert to PDF for print.
- LDS GC talks > format html and convert to PDF for print.
- Lead to HTML articles for interpreting class that can be made into PDF for print.

css4.pub apparently runs on Prince https://www.princexml.com/ which may or may not be helpful and/or too indepth.

**What typographic adjustment libraries would be helpful here?**

This is intended to be a web typographic experiment on John Bulwer's 1644 Chirologia. It won't be comprehensive — it's much too long — and it won't be typographically perfect — while there are good typographic candidates in the

nothing looks like four-hundred-year-old typography.

(Check out this CSS property for justified text: http://www.css3.com/css-text-justify)

So, as of this writing, it will try to take advantage of layout, typographic, and, most importantly/frustratingly, letterform consistencies. I'll likely introduce color into the design as I try to replicate an original seventeenth-century work.

This work by Bulwer (in connection with Juan Pablo Bonet's 1620 renderings of manual alphabet handshapes [Reducción de las letras y arte para ensenar a hablar los neudos ("Summary of the letters and the art of teaching speech to the mute")]) is personal to me in my other work as a researcher of deaf studies and the visual representation of signed languages.
